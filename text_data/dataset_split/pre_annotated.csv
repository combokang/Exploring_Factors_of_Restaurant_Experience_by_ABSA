"How this restaurant gets 5 stars is beyond me. Or.. rather, it’s paid astroturfing,    The portions are small, and the prices leave much to be desired. I was extremely excited to see more Asian options in midtown, but fam, this ain’t it."
I have been coming here since I am 15 years old. The food has remained consistent and fantastic for 33 years that I can recall. Love the Hop Kee …
"Great food, accommodating kitchen and friendly and helpful waiting staff."
"Good Thai food, fair New York City prices. The outdoor dining ambiance is beautiful, with greenery everywhere. The drinks we got were beautiful as well! Service was fast although our waitress seemed to be rushing us a bit - it’s a popular place so I think they are trying to move tables quickly. Overall, the food was good and the experience was positive."
"The line was long during lunch hour in the freezing cold right after Christmas weekend. The pierogi's were well worth it! Delicious, homemade, and reminds me of home."
The customer device is very bad. The food took forever to get here and it wasn’t even that good like.... …
I give it four stars i love the curry chicken everything was nice except the price $13 with like two pieces of chicken with a bunch of rice and peas no complaints about the food but the price im from queens living in the bronx i was traveling to queens for Caribbean food when i came across this place on google maps i can get a large plate for $10.50 with mad chicken and gravy with rice & peas over all food is good its the price 
"I had the 4 cheese stuffed burger on a ciabatta roll.  Good service the food was piping hot and delicious.   The decor is old and not updated since the last time I was there which was over 10 years ago, but I still enjoyed my food!"
Oysters is good. Fresh
"Great service, food was mediocre edible but not outstanding.  I had red snapper which was covered in a sauce disguising the taste of the fish. My partner had veal with artichoke which he said was just ok also.  Just not what we were hoping to get in NY. Wines were blah"
Our all time favorite restaurant.  Great food. All food on the menue exceeds expectations.  Old type of service from the entire staff. They make you feel very special.
Very good place to eat Dominican food
Great food options. Very delicious and tasty food
Good food. But i wish they had new tables and seats  some of they tables lean or move while eating..
Theyre over priced with poor customer service. I use to order here but the price of rice always changes.  Some meats are leftovers from the day before. I also made a purchase over the phone with my debit card. The next day i had an odd purchase of 150$ for a vitamin shop in jersey city.  The owner price gouges as he buys products at a high price from local convenient stores.  Its a shame the family makes good food but extremely mismanaged
Good place to have a Dim Sum. Very good dumplings.
They gave us a lot of fries and vegetables I wasn’t there to eat those things The sashimi portion was too small I should have gotten only sashimi Don’t get sashimi set
"Atmosphere was perfect. Great music,  beautiful art. There's a beautiful 3D collage of the islands that's truly captivating.  The drinks were great- loved the mango margaritas! The food was great too, but the salmon could've used a bit more seasoning.  The sauce it was in was divine,  it needed a little more of that.    Definitely worth it!"
Authentic Chinese
"I find myself ordering from here more and more.  Pad woonsen, basil sauce, spring rolls. I like this place a lot. Recommended for quick Thai"
"Great atmosphere, better food and kind, courteous staff. Most welcoming place in the neighborhood"
it's good and clean
The bartender there - the cute skinny one  was spot-on with her recommendation for the shrimp tempura sushi. Best bar pie around. Impressive selection of craft beer. …
Always fresh always good.  Great people great food
Ordered the roast duck chow mein it was nasty. The duck full has alot of fat no kind of meat. The rest of my order was good. When me and my kids got home we felt very nauseous and sick. The soda was over priced and the charged for refills
"Very good supply of islands products.. the cashier's personality was a bit cold.  Never had June plum juice..I live far away so I bought it, not looking at the date on the box... didn't  notice until reaching home it was expiring the day after I bought it.. please do better G.K"
4.5 stars - delicious Thai food!    Nicely decorated for a fun date night vibe.  Service was fast and friendly.   Only thing I'd take points off for were the cocktails.  The two we had fell a bit flat.
Worst Indian food ever. Too expensive.
"Food was below average, paneer served in the curry seemed to be from dead stock, not that worth."
Food is delicious but the service could be better.
"Great food, good price"
I had a clerical error hopefully it is corrected
"We had a large family gathering of out-of-towners to feed after an emotionally draining service at a local cemetery. The staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome and well taken care of. The food was outstanding and prepared to everyone's liking, which is not easy with 10+ burgers (well, medium-well, medium-rare, etc) being served at once. They obviously work hard, and work hard to find and keep excellent staff. Cheers to the Iron Horse!"
"The staff was friendly and the food was great. I ordered chimichangas and my friend ordered enchiladas. The plates were huge and full of the main course, rice, beans and toppings. You get free chips and salsa--yum! We also had the fried ice cream --wow, definitely make room for dessert. It was pretty empty when we went, so it's nice and peaceful there. They have a large flat-screen TV too if you want to watch TV."
Good food and price. The table is a bit small for two people (the waiter knocked the coke down by accident..)
Great food
"I ordered Spicy Cumin Mutton Lunch, spring rolls and hot&sour soup, to go. Mutton is very spicy with dry red peppers, very flavorful, cumin and lamb go excellent together. The meet is a bit smoky and very tender. Rolls and soup are pretty good too.  I don't know how good the service is, but the food is excellent!"
Only picked up gift certificates
Fake business.+8801782118031 WhatsApp
Food was okay. Male Server was distracted. Female server was bilingual and kind. They do serve Pellegrino and not just generic sparkling water.
Our family went to try this restaurant on a late Sunday afternoon on a relatively nice day. I called beforehand to ensure they had outdoor seating available on that day and time. We had been looking forward to trying the restaurant as they have advertised about their outdoor tent area. When we arrived the waiter said he wouldn't seat us outside because they did not want to go in and out to serve people.  What!!!?!?????!  We drove over 30 minutes to get there and had to turn around and head home.
"Good food,  orders done to liking"
"Very good bbq, fast, clean, good atendance"
"Nice little spot off of Kings Point ! Friendly staff and quick service. To start they serve fried yucca with a delicious Peruvian green sauce. The lomo is delicious , it contains French fries and vegetables. Avocado salad has a creamy garlic dressing , fresh lettuce , avocado and tomatoes! Sangria has a great taste and perfect amount of strong. Def recommend for a date night or girls night out."
"Beautiful interior, nice bamboo wall in bar area, nice decorations.  Good size portions, not the skimpy portions some places serve.  Very friendly, attentive staff."
The emperor has no clothes. Yet another over hyped restaurant where patrons confuse the prices of dishes for quality. The service was terrific.
"Always love coming here.  Hasn't changed in 20 years and that's a great thing.  Food is always delicious, services was great! Highly recommended!"
Delicious food ! Was surprised if how large portions were this is old fashion eating!!
Pork soup dumplings taste so good.  But Do Not expect to their service..and lighting color is uncomfortable.
limited lunch menu. Quality is good and does get busy so if you are creature of habit and find what you like here and just get that each time it can work. If you are like me and get bored with the same old... then you might want to try once and move on.
Food is good and reasonable. Staff is very friendly.
"Great restaurant in Chinatown that offers authentic Chinese cuisine. Menu has photos as well as English descriptions of each item, so visiting tourists won't need to guess what each dish is. Wait staff mostly have a decent grasp on English so this defintiely makes it easier to order. Does get a little loud around dinner time."
Excellent food people atomosphere
"Incredible first experience at this establishment!  First off, our waiter was the best!  All of his recommendations for brunch were outstanding from drinks to food!  Will definitely return for dinner!!"
Best birria tacos!!
"I would imagine people come here to drink the alcohol, because the food and service weren't good at all.    Our order of Cold Sesame Noodle was served hot. We had a Chicken Curry dish which was more of a soup. For food, I'd avoid this spot, it's just too bad I'm not a drinker."
Large portions and close to Bergen Pac
"Love Poke! Great service, excellent food very consistent."
"Nice atmosphere,  good food and a very nice bartender too"
"Great place but owner/managers are terrible. I always try to give this place a try but it’s so ghetto. Owner and security allowing customers to walk around the restaurant without even being confronted and act crazy as people are sitting and dining. I come to party and have a good time, the food and drinks are good but I feel like its A free for all there amongst staff. Last month I came and sat in a blue booth and witness ppl owner and customers carrying on as if it’s not his place!"
We do not like the condensed new menu and the captain waa rude when we explain that we prefer previously they had more steaks selection and asked us if we prefer to leave and eat across the street. Food was good not great and after this time we will never return. Vibe is bad
The wait was horrible. Took us an hour to get seated and an additional 20 mins to get served drinks not food. I had my 2 toddlers with me but luckily as a mom i had snacks and drinks for them while we waited and ended up taking their meal home. Smh never again! I would have appreciated it if they were honest n told us the appropriate waiting time than continually saying 10 minutes more.
The food is excellent certain servers could be a lil rude.
"First time trying Cuban/Dominican food and was not disappointed! Went for the oxtail with yellow rice and black beans and a cheese empanada. Everything was delicious, especially surprised how tasty the rice and beans were as I expected them to just be *there*. The cafe con leche absolutely hit the spot too. Service was quick, patient and friendly - would highly recommend if you're in the neighbourhood."
the service was great!!  and the food was great To!! 
Environment is still the same after all of these years...need a little updating in the entrance area....food was ok not great like before...waitress not attentive enough...bar was overtaking the restaurant portion with loud music which wasn't up to date....ambiance  was still alright
Great food .
"A small gem right in the middle of Hackensack.  Food is great and service just outstanding.  Those fajitas come out so hot, omg!  Loved those shrimp tacos."
"I really like this restaurant. The quality of the food and the cooking are top notch. The prices are in line with other Indian restaurants. As far as atmosphere, it is very Indian. The lighting is a little dark for me, kind of a romantic feel. The music is a continual loop of, ""I'm guessing"".Hindu chants. I have only been to SoIR once, so I'll leave an updated review the next time I visit."
Great Chinese food from Guyana
"If you order chicken fingers and calamari, you expect it to be crispy, but they were soggy. It made us wonder if it was microwaved or fresh made.    If you have a family member that eats cod and knows what good quality cod is but tell you don't bring it home, it is a bit concerning especially if you are a pregnant patron."
Best asain  pakistani food
Good portion sizes and tasty food
Very delicious dishes with reasonable prices.  I got the special bun (rice vermicelli dish) and as always it was spot on.  I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here.
Excellent as usual     I have been ordering from Albasha for over a two years     They sell fresh and authentic Mediterranean cuisine and honestly they are my go to whenever I am craving a mixed grilled plate     Weather weekday or weekend and craving a Mediterranean food adventure is my go to restaurant 
"The staff here and super racist and stuck up. We were a few minutes early for our reservation and they wouldn't seat us and were rude to us. They were nice to all the white customers that came in after us. Such horrible service, don't go here."
OMG! Great food & prices too
Food was great and service was on point.
"Great lunch too. Porchetta sandwich is amazing, moist pork, great pickles, perfectly toasted bread. Fries are also incredible"
"I love Olive Garden, and this location was great! Even we waited for a long time because it was very busy, our waiter gave us an awsome service and also all the waiters sang Happy Birthday to my best friend (It was her first time at Olive Garden and first time visiting this country) she loved the experience.    It looks like all the employees have a great work environment, and they look very happy and united."
Varieties!!!  The main Hispanic food are served here.  Food is great and price is reasonable.  Service can be slow at time which can cause long wait.  Overall good restaurant
Aways good food and great waiter staff. Clean neat and well worth the visit.
Great food
We have very few good breakfast places close to us  This is a great place to experience good food and service...GREAT breakfast !
Very good food and portion are realy big.
"Great food, good atmosphere, very nice employees too. Thanks for always coming thru in the clutch!"
"Quality Chilean food, pleasant atmosphere, excellent service, recommended. Takeaway, consumption and home delivery."
"The entrees were extremely good. The main dishes were ok, and there is a nice offer of wines. The staff is very friendly and helpful and the restaurant as a very nice vibe. I would have liked if they had given us a slightly bigger table, a hit tight for the nr of people."
No water for you......refused to give us water untill we buy either the bottle water or the poured one....place is hotter than being outside in the chinatown sweltering heat
Too long line but ok if you compare the price
I cant say anything bad about carmines I arrived on time for my reservation and me and my party of 3 were seated promptly the waitress was very attentive the food was excellent all very large portions so do not order a plate of anything and expect to eat it by yourself you can try it but I doubt it very seriously it was slightly chilly inside which can be uncomfortable oh yea if they could toast the Italian bread instead of it being cold that'll be awsome but I'm just nit picking now great place great food
I have been eating here for 15 years. Never disappoints. Friendly owner and fabulous food.
"It has been our most frequented place lately :) A friendly team, delicious food, an immaculate place.. I highly recommend it."
The food is delicious and the portions are great
"Wifey and I were here prepandemic and absolutely loved it. The ambiance, the food, everything... great time,  now I see its reopened and you know I have to set a reservation to go again ASAP!"
To spicy and expensive.
Good food
"elegant dining room, sophisticated table setting awaiting you,  superb and imaginative food preparations (seared foie gras over divers scallops? oh, my!) and team service attentive to the point where you feel like you are the only guests in the room. how belle epoche is that?  the whole evening in this restaurant was exceptional; it felt like a command performance for a truly special occasion."
Fresh food and friendly owners.
"Beautiful ambiance, wonderful energy in the dining room. Food was excellent - the tilefish was exceptional. Our wonderful dinner was only spoiled by our waiter John's passive aggressiveness. Not sure why he was in such a bad mood, but he was being extremely rude. Not sure if we will return due to the service."
"The service is unmatched. The staff truly cares about your experience & The food is absolutely amazing I had the pleasure of being served by Shannon she’s the best, definitely will be going back."
"This restaurant is so cute! The inside is very fun, but a little loud.  We were lucky to get an outside table in a private seating area that was adorable.    The servers are very friendly and outgoing.  The presentation of the vegetable spring rolls was very creative and they tasted great!"
So happy to have a good breakfast spot so near to my park slope apt- the only other options are bagel bakeries (I can only have so many) or mediocre diners. The Latin soon on many of the dishes is a welcome change.  Eggs are well executed and well seasoned. Chocolate chip pancakes FTW!
Been coming here for years.  Everything I have ordered here has been delicious!  Very vegetarian-friendly.  Incredible Sunday brunch - so much food you won't be able to taste it all.  Friendly service and non-stop water glass filling.
Excellent service and very good food.    We had dinner here on Tuesday evening based on the Google reviews. We had an excellent waiter and it’s a really cool location. They have several dining rooms and even an amusement park of some sort in the back.    I thought the food was very good. The steak was cooked correctly and the rice/chips were interesting. My buddy said the short ribs were on point.
Always.love love love olive garden. Our waitress was top notch. Cant remember her name but she was super bubbly and pleasant and helpful. She even kneeled on floor and packed up my To go badge since there was a lot to bring home.
Transitional Chinese Sichuan spicy food.
"Always a solid choice.  Plus a fun place to bring out of towners, food and an experience!  You  have to be a little agressive to get the items you want, but that's half the fun."
"Great little place to grab some quick variety of packaged dishes like seafood pancake, takoyaki, eel over rice, Bulgogi, banchan, hot soups, etc.  There are high tables and seats for you to dine in after purchase and a cute little microwave in the back (pay to use).    They offer 8% off if you pay in cash."
"It has good indoor dining, beans were horrible and falafel was ok.., wasn’t worth it, but it’s nice place to dine in with your friends"
Great food and service.
Good quality Sushi at this restaurant. Service is fast.
What a nice surprise. I'm happy they've been in the neighborhood for so long and I'll be going back soon. Try the port wine is fantastic!!
"Great food and very  reasonable price, Excellent service,  100% recommend."
The place does not have a good staff.  They hired a bunch of kids that don't even know how to wait on tables. We sat there for over 15 minutes waiting to be asked if we wanted something to drink. Then at no time did they even return back toask us if we needed anything else. They did the same thing to the table right next to us. We had to ask someone to come by just to get water refills! Ridiculous!!!
"I'm a big fan of olive garden and Italian kitchen overall. This used to be a good olive garden location but not anymore. The waiters were not friendly at all, the place smelled bad, the food was not good. What mostly bothered me is that servers were not wearing anything to cover their hair while carrying food. There were literally girls carrying a tray of food and their hair was falling inside the tray! That was disgusting. Thankfully our food was brought by someone else. Overall not a good experience."
Definitely won't be dissatisfied.  Food is on point.  One of my favorite places.
"Always delicious, freshest hummus around!"
"This Place is in Parsippany NJ. We went here after a lot of positive reviews about the food and the place did not disappoint. Would have given a 5 start but their crowd management is plain pathetic. Coming to the food, do not miss the paneer fries and the appum. The Mysore masala dosa was great as well. We ended on the pineapple dessert which was mouth watering. Definitely recommend this place but should try to visit on a non occasion day."
"Yesterday, we hosted our Christening party for  little Jon Michael.  Family and friends all agreed the food was great and the service was excellent. Thank you for a great experience! Excellent value!"
"Classic neighborhood Italian. If what you want isn't on the menu, ask and they will try to accommodate."
Good place for Asian fusion.  Lounge feel and excellent view of Manhattan from the near by park make this a great place to bring visiting friends.
"This is a great classic, you can return to for an ADULT, SERIOUS DINNER. We went with a large group and were treated like royalty. This place only hires pros. No actor/model wanna bes who are waiting tables as a gig. This is the real deal and the food is perfect - the beef on the bone was incredible... the lamb... the pasta... the burrata..."
Love the Brazilian food
"It was recently my first time ordering from here and the food is amazing!!! The chicken & waffles were amazing, will be ordering from here again."
"This place is great!  The food is delicious and the service is great, very friendly! I highly recommend eating here."
"the food was not up to par. the place looks decent, but it was not to our liking to sit and eat"
"I eat Tony's pizza 2-5 times a week. These guys hold it down big time. The pizza is good, you have a lot of choices. They are legit to deal with too, you know it gets hectic in there and they keep things running professional. I love Tony's."
"Friendly staff, tasty pho with a uearty portion size.  Will come back to try more of the menu"
"I was getting takeout. Service was horrible. I was already in a rush, waiter tells me my spring rolls would take only five minutes. After I make the payment with the cashier, he tells me it will take 15 minutes to make TWO spring rolls and ONE avocado shake. The springs rolls (made of noodles and shrimp and raw chickem) tasted disgusting. Noodles tasted raw. Shrimp tastes like it was frozen. AND it took 20 minutes to get my order. Absolutely horrible."
"While the view was pleasant,  the menu very limited and far too pricey.  For brunch you're paying $17 for eggs,  no drink,  no coffee,  nothing!  Add to that the service was awful.   Very disappointing. I watched one man at another table get up three times to get the waitress.  They waited 20 minutes for drinks only to have  the wrong wine brought over."
"Awesome restaurant. Great food and ambience, huge dining room you don't often see in the area."
"Love the family size dishes; each dish is plentiful. When you do order, each dish serves 2-3 people. For a table of 2, I suggest one appetizer, and one entree. There will be more than enough to take home depending on what you get. The staff is very attentive, and professional. My food choices of Baked Clams, and Pene A La Vodka with Chicken were very good."
Great food a huge selection to choose from.  Staff is very friendly.
Nice place great food!
"Excellent food! Lucky to be seated into the last seat on Friday. The service was a bit slow  at the peak time understandably. The atmosphere feels like the one I visited in Madrid area. Overall, the place is a must to experience. I'll definitely to be back here many times."
I loved the bar area and the drinks were excellent.
I must say Iam never disappointed with eating at this place food is always delicious very friendly place I will be visiting soon  …
Good drinks
I was there for a birthday party celebration. The food was awesome. I would definitely go back to eat again.
Ordered from there and it took them 1 hour to deliver my food just for my food to get there and everything is not in my bag they missed a whole platter and another one of my platters was wrong not to mention that I repeated the order twice and then the lady who took the order repeated it then when I called them back to let them know what was wrong they said they were going to send someone out with the corrections to my order and no one came
"Was there for a Christening. Food was delicious, service was exceptional!"
"Tried grilled beef and it was good. Not the best but pretty good. Thai ice tea was also nice, not very sweet."
"Amazing food, service and atmosphere! Best paella I have ever tasted!"
Great food - especially liked the kitfo.
My first time at Evelyn's was amazing! I told the bartender to give me a suggestion and he mixed me a delicious drink. He was really friendly and I'm definitely going back for the customer service. I definitely recommend!!
"Great atmosphere, love the decorations. Nice lighting, menu has pictures which os very helpful with deciding on the dish. Duck was nice and crispy. A little dry bit the crispyness made up for it. Thai ice tea was great. I recommend coming here as a date or with friends."
All you can eat sushi for $27.95.  Handrolls are fantastic.
Loved the food and I had a great time. Chicken gyoza was amazing and I ended up ordering a second order of it. I'll definitely come back to this play. It's a bit pricey but the food is delicious and a great place to take a date. Highly recommend it.
Quality food and good service.
"Excellent service, and exquisite French cuisine! Whether you grab a table in the front cafe/ bar area, or stay in the restaurant itself, it’s an exceptional ambience for meeting with friends or business colleagues."
"Enjoy coming here with family. Love the fact that it is a vegetarian restaurant, so many more options to try now."
My favorite place to eat Mangu! I havent ate a better mangu yet.
"Great food, great service"
Always a good food and good people
"Pleasent place, very good service. The food can't be better. I'll drive any time to enjoy this great Peruvian food."
"Wow, I went here in 2011 and again in 2023. I remember last time they had bakery items and a buffet to make your own lunch tray. Now it's only packages items, at least in the evening when I went. Everything was delicious!"
"Delicious authentic Vietnamese food! I ordered Pho and was one of the best I have had. Also ordered a side of the shrimp veggie rolls and were super yummy!! Restaurant is BYOB, clean, and excellent service!"
The food was great! Also Cucumber Mint Martini was literally awesome!
"Good food, excellent service and the all you can eat sushi Tues is EVERYTHING!!"
Great place to eat. Really like the Atmosphere!
"Mediocre. Nice spot, pretty sleek interior. But pints at 13oz and small cocktails. What is this, a bar for ants?"
I'm never disappointed. Thankfully they still do take out
Excellent Italian Restaurant!! Will be back again and again
"For at least 10 years before traveling to my Moroccan home, I would invite about 20 people to an annual going away dinner at Flor de Mayo restaurant.    Once the secret got out about the large portions and very reasonable prices (for Manhattan), people began traveling from other areas of the city just to eat here.    Weekends can be very busy and noisy. The chicken is my favorite, with plantains."
This spot is on point! Went there on a Tuesday evening and everything the service to the food was A+.
Very good homemade Italian food.Drinks where nice and strong  also
I absolutely loved every single dish on the vegetarian platter! So so so good!
Great Dim Sum.  We've been eating here on a regular basis for 20 years. Super reliable and consistent.
The entree combo and main dish was amazing staff were very friendly and nice. good vibe and clean. we really enjoyed
Last night I placed an order. I ordered catfish and yellow rice with pigeon peas and i had an uptown and plantains. My daughter in law had grilled shrimp with herbs and garlic white rice and cabbage. The food was still hot when it got to us. The taste abd seasoning was everything. They called us as well to tell us what wasn't available. Thank you Monique for your great customer service. Will be ordering again soon. Many blessings and success on the business
Always love my Olive Garden!! I just wish they took reservations! It's a hit or miss with the waiters- most are great but some are careless.
Chicken broth is delicious
"Excellent food and Service, not your typical Mexican restaurant"
Best burger I’ve ever had. The portions were great and the burger wasn’t too big. Can’t wait to go back again.
"Service was fine. Main course was very blane., not enough seasoning. Appetizers where nice."
"The restaurant and the banquet hall is nice and cleaner than the other places but the food was okay. The appetizers were fine but the main course was not that good. No taste, presentation was poor."
Food is alright but you get the feeling that they want to get rid of you when you finished your food
"It was good. Nice menu, you can get japanese, chinese and hibachi I. The same place. Good food, nicely done rolls with a little rice. Good seafood combination platter. Fried rice was called and kind of tasteless. Really nice ambiance."
"It was ok, based on a recommendation by our concierge. We enjoyed the atmosphere and the fish was fresh but it just wasn't stellar. Natsumi is great on the go-but would love it if the experience matched the prices."
Maggie is the best.  Great food and great service Period !!!  Ivy
Excellent food. Friendly staff/owners. All around perfect experience!!
"Excellent! The ambiance, decor are fantastic,  food is delicious and the service very attentive.  Definitely a must visit !!"
Friendly helpful waiters.  Best chicken soup.  Yucca fries with green sauce.  Ceviche as good as it looks. Yum!
"Stumbled upon this quaint little resturant last night! I loved the small, cozy vibe inside along with the wide selection of food on the menu. The staff were attentive and the food came out quickly (and delicious). Will definitely come back here another time!"
"Food was good. We had chicken tikka masala, beef karahi, beef kabob. Place is bit crowded."
The food is good. Price is too high. The tip should be at the discretion of the customer not their decision.  There shouldn't be an extra 10% charge for paying with a credit card. The drinks are great but not worth paying extra money just to go have it.
"Food is great, people are great, service is great, and most caring and honest guys in the world. We had an issue with payment and approached the cashier he accommodated us with smiley face and helped us in every possible way. It was a great experience going there. Definitely going there again.  Alex is a great guy over there do greet and meet him."
Food is amazing....they just take hell ah long....I waited almost 2 hours fi mi food
"Good everything. Good food, huge portions. chicken parmegiana is really good. Well cooked and juicy. Penne alla vodka is also very tasty. For dessert try the canolli with pistachios. Service also very good."
Great place for all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ. Meat is fresh and the service is attentive. Highly recommended
Love the food and the atmosphere.  We have eaten here many times and always have a great time. The staff here  make  you feel like family.
Its ok
The fried chicken is incredibly crispy and flavorful! Good banchan. Friendly service :)
Excellent food. Attentive staff. Good value for the money.
This place is def a legit home made Viet spot and it hits all the bases. Refreshing to find a place I can call my new Go To Spot when I’m in the area.    Get the Bun Thit Nuong (Noodle Bowl with grilled meat) - the grilled strips of sweet marinated pork made this dish incredible
We went for a weekend buffet and reached just 30 min before close... they still accommodated us and we were able to enjoy a very tasty meal... we did have to rush a bit but they hadn't run out of anything or substituted any item for a not so good one despite us being one of the last customers.
La Cashina is a family operated Italian Restaurant. They are very good at that. The dishes are freshly cooked and the service is immediate and polite.
Excellent food and upscale atmosphere
Gotta love the cheese filled burgers!
Popular and inexpensive Vietnamese restaurant with plenty of soups and rice dish options. The restaurant gets crowded especially at lunchtime during the week.
Very disappointed. Expensive prices for small appetizer plates which they call it lunch. Don't recommend it to anyone
The food was amazing not to over cooked or anything it as a lot of good flavor and the Service is incredibly you should go there
Great service friendly staff food is tasty.
"Great food, friendly staff and very fast service. The dimsum was solid and dishes were super quick to come out. Really enjoyed the atmosphere"
The food is always great. It was a little crowded but the service was good.
The absolute best Macedonian / Bankan food.  The place has a great vibe and the service is excellent.  I highly recommend it!
"I usually get the beef Thenthuk. Made fresh with plenty of flavor. One of my local favorites for Queens. Easy drive from Long Island and parked outside within 5 minutes. Lhasa has been around for a while, the original spot was made famous by Anthony Bourdain in Parts Unknown… Will bring my Dad & family here"
Great place for Greek pastry.
This place is a gem when you want Turkish and Mediterranean food. Literally everything is so delicious. My wife and I keep coming back to this place. I definitely recommend it!
"My new favorite place - scallops, cauliflower steak, mushroom toast, wine. Fab"
They said they served breakfast but was limited on the breakfast menu
"I had a good time. The food was good. This is very crowded place. You need to wait at least 30 min. wait time for a table, and I had to share with strangers. It is banquet hall setting. They come to you with different dishes to choose from."
Delicious authentic peruvian style chicken for a very reasonable price. Recommended
Love their Vietnamese spring rolls...they're so addicting
"This place is fantastic. I think of it as Dhamaka except the service is really good. A+++ food, great atmosphere. The chaat is out of this world"
"This is a very Family Friendly Establishment...  They are Family Owned for many Years!  If U don't see what U want on the Menu....  Just ask and the Chef will prepare it for U!!  I asked for Seafood Fra Diablo... WOW... Its was Delicious!!!  We told them that it was my Birthday,,, they surprised us with Cannolies !!!  Thank U Tony!!!  We will return soon!!!"
Wonderful costumer service & delicious food!!
"Love the staff especially the two females and the chef that cater to us,they we were so loving.(LOL)Food was good too."
"Came here for mother's day celebrations, food was great, but the service was exceptional!! Our waiter Samir (not sure of spelling) was fantastic! He went above and beyond for our huge family!! Spoke with us in all our languages, and made everyone feel like they were the only person he was serving!! I will definitely come here again thanks to him!!"
Best and most authentic Italian I've ever had.  I could only understand about half of what the waiter said but that was more than enough :)
Come here quite often with my family. The Bourbon ribs are delicious. I love the stuffed shrimp. Service is good Jose is usually our waiter and is attentive. Good food.
"We went for lunch, my wife ordered a dry chicken and I ordered a dry goat, we waited approximately 40 minutes for them to serve us the food, for the price the dish cost us, the amount of food they served us was very little, bad served , we left very dissatisfied and still hungry ."
Food is OK. I was thrilled to learn it was vegetarian/vegan. Drove 30 minutes to try this place. Person in the front was nice and polite. Food was a bit spicy despite me choosing not spicy. The biggest disappointment was the sticky rice. I just got a small glob for $3.50. Maybe the presentation threw me off but i didn’t expect it to be a literal small scoop of rice . Overall we would definitely go back and next time we will dine in and see how that experience is.
"Good food. Our waitress (I think her name was April), was great. I'd go again if in the mood. It was a bit loud at 8 PM, but then it got very quiet around 9 PM. Restaurant is huge. Bathrooms were not the best IMO."
On menu was each order 26$ lamb haneeth we ordered 4 late they charged me 36$ each I paid for that 143$ total be carful guys ….
"It was just OK overall. The chorizo clams were the tastiest out of what I ordered with friend. Honestly,  for the prices, the decor needs some serious updates. The women's bathroom, at around 7 on a weekday, was completely filthy, so much so that I told our server."
Great Macedonian cuisine
"Amazing food, music, and atmosphere.  I have been there a few times and unfortunately my waiter this last time sucked. He didnt come to check on us and purposely dissapeared until happy hour was over."
"Wow, I was amazed! This is a definite 4.5 to me. All I care about is food quality and this is one of the only times I have liked chicken tikka. The balance of spice, heat, and flavor was right on point. The naan was soft hot and pillowy. Finally, the portion size was great--I have more than enough for two meals at $13 for lunch. Just make sure to ask for something made today. Cheers!"
Great food warm and friendly staff
"Looks are deceiving. Place looks decent but the food looks like you can make it at home in a microwave. Horrible service. Almost killed my friend with an onion allergy he asked multiple times if there were onions. They said there were no onions in anything he ordered, everything he ordered came with onions."
"Food was pretty good. The Morel burger was a little overdone; I asked for medium and it was closer to well done. Cheese topping on burger wasn't melted but it was a tasty burger, nevertheless. Fries were good too. Had the crab cake as an appetizer and it was delicious. My wife had the vegetarian Cajun dish and said it was good too. A little on the pricey side, but presentation and quality were good, so worth the visit."
"I ordered pierogi's with eggs and kielbasa served with sour cream and a beet horseradish salad. This food felt so good going down! Nourishing to the soul as well as the body. It made me so happy, I came back a couple of days later and ordered the same thing again. All staff were incredibly friendly. I adore this place!"
"Lovely atmosphere, great food and service."
"Great atmosphere, attentive service at the table, moderate prices for Manhattan"
Great service
I had a great experience fast service and  Friendly employees
We were seated and waited for 20 minutes for our server to never show up. Many servers walked past us and around us and never bothered to ask us if we've been helped.
"Plenty of food, good service. A place to visit for good food."
Just had there a couple of drinks in late afternoon. Definitely too noisy and crowded. A nice place but not if you want to chat with someone.
Best food we have ate. This restaurant is the best. The food was awesome and very yeasty. Not at all spicy as my family prefers. The best we have ever had in both New York and New Jersey. I have not ate like this in Atlanta GA either.    Highly Recommended.
Literally one of the best places to go. you have to try there brunch. The  croque madameis out of this world.
"The last time I ordered pizza here it was terrible and the kids working the register were high. Shame, it used to be really good."
"It's nice to finally find a great Italian restaurant in NYC with fresh produce, really nice atmosphere, great food and great service, I would recommend"
"In NJ, this Chinese restaurant must be a five star. Authentic Cantonese cuisine, good service."
"Let me just warn you. ITS SO DELICIOUS!!!! Im originally from buschwick and now that I live in the south I miss my NY pizza. So every time i have the chance to visit NY, I always make sure to stop by Tony's . The pizza is delicious and seriously the best I've ever had!! The staff is also very friendly and they have awesome customer service! Will come back every chance i have :) Thankyou tony's!!"
Best Chinese food i have ever had
"Decent food, but a huge bee problem while I was there."
Loved everything about this place from the beautiful ambiance and design of the restaurant to the delicious food. The food was phenomenal and everything tasted so good. I also have to add how amazing the service was. The employees there are very kind and always checking up on you. Definitely one of my new favorite spots
"Very good, quick service, the food was delicious we.went for breakfast and left satisfied. Thank you so much, recommend for sure."
"This spot never disappoints. They serve excellent food for affordable rates, there is no waiting time even when the spot is busy."
"Good food, good service plus nice ambiance is a total of an awesome place. A place definitely worth going back!"
Good atmosphere. Ginger tea is delicious. Food is wonderful. Great surpise.  A must go to gem in sunnyside
Great place and service. Food was very fresh. The deserts were perfect.
Customer service has improved. First time there on a Friday night...very busy. Staff were good at being attentive. Good local spot for sushi
"Good food, music is too loud for first timers. Regulars seemed fine"
Great soup
Excellent customer service  Sushi is delicious and fresh.
I recommend the place...
Great food
bad delivery service
Love the food. It was freshly made. And the service was excellent. And the desert. Chocolate layer lasagna. Superb.
This diner is welcoming because of the staff. There appears to be minimum turnover of personnel and that makes for a familiar crew. Familiar with their customers and their likes. Food is always piping hot and tasty.
The best quipe ever I have tried the 3 Rico Chimi and the quipes of this one have no comparison 
"The food was delicious, service was great, very reasonable prices. I would highly recommend it !!!"
"Attended an event here at the back of the restaurant, a beautiful mosaic space with a little fountain, and plenty of seating for our party of 30 guests.  I had the Chicken BBQ Sandwich, so good! Our food came with a thicker pita bread, hummus, and baba ganoush which was sooooo good! It's affordable too for a big party, I would come again.  Friendly staff too."
Decent food good prices
Very good place for indian and chinese cuisine. Super friendly staff and low waiting times for food.  Overall 9/10
"As far as the food,  I tried EFD's seafood & broccoli breakfast omelet (I think that's what it was labeled on the menu...my bad...think it's labeled a New Orleans'). This omelet is (in the voice of P~Funk) ""the bomb .""    Also? Their grilled chicken w/eggs (had mine scrambled...I was being greedy that Saturday) ? Not bad "
"The food is so good, the portions are fair. Service was nice but the place itself isn't all that appealing. We sat at the top section of the restaurant, I know they have another dining area. But anyways, food is great I reccomend. The prices are good!"
Good food
Food is amazing here!
After going to this place 2 times I can see why they get almost a perfect 5 star the food was amazing and my 3 guest had the same opinion. The filet mignon was possibly the best I have ever had! Not to mention the crab meat and mushroom crepe.
good food
"More or less attention, good food"
Good place to eat. The food is good and the services is excellent.
ever since dim sum villa suddenly closed we were left searching for our go to place... we don't have to go to staten island anymore... just 15 min away from us... service was really good too...
"stew fish, curry mango, and pumpkin were especially good"
"Psari is an incredible restaurant! The ambience, staff, and the food are awesome. I've been here for both dinner on my wedding day as well as my anniversary. The food was fresh and not over seasoned. The flavors were delicious! I definitely recommend them for a great night out!"
Best penne alla vodka! Staff is super nice and friendly!
"We have been getting take out from here since the pandemic. The menu and dim sum menu are limited but the food is great as usual. Now they have a special dinner set , 3 dishes with soup and rice for only 31.95. Take out only.  Lots of food for 2 ppl with plenty leftover.  Probably enough for a family of four.  Where do u get authentic Cantonese dinner at $32 nowadays?!    Just go and you won’t be disappointed "
The waitress service was excellent.  I was disappointed with the food. I ordered pasta with marinara sauce and received it with meat sauce twice. Don't eat here if your vegetarian and or vegan.
"Great friendly bartenders, great DJ, quick service when ordering food and nice atmosphere, also has security which is a plus"
"Probably not the best spot for Tibetan food. Momo's were spread out on plate, I don't know if it's for presentation or if it's to make it look more. It didn't worked for either purpose. We went for some warm Tibetan food on cold rainy evening but didn't really helped.  The servers were nice and came back to check on us."
The best Shakshuka in town! Amazing food and service. Highly recommended. The manager Ari is great.
"Vinod was our server today, and he was very accommodating and explained any questions we had.  The service was quick and exceptional.  Food was flavorful and very tasty.  Can’t wait to come back!"
This place is very cozy. Staff is always friendly and attentive. Food is delicious.
"Great place! I ate in the 'bar' section, which was a little less expensive than the main restaurant. Still good for, though! My guests had two seafood parts dishes and i had the 'Vegan', a few pasta dish. All the were great, sizable, and the service was great! Will be back."
"Very nice establishment. Food was delicious. This place is BYOB, so be prepared before you go (there's a liquor store literally next door, so not a big deal). It's rather small, so if you have a big party, I would call ahead to make arrangements. Lighting was low enough to be nice but not too dark. Staff seems nice. There's a pizzeria attached through a separate entrance for take away also."
"Their food is good but they have no customer service skills...no patient, rude they nice to only people they personally know. When they servicing your food they give what they and when u try to explain or tell them what u want they give u attitude. I'm paying it's not free so I have the choice to get I want. At the end of the day they lack customer service skills and management needs to take all the employees to go learn some CS skills..."
"Drinks were decent priced, bartenders were very attentive and professional, the food was beyond my expectations and was served quick, and the atmosphere was live. I completely loved this place!"
MUST HAVE THE CHOBAN SALAD
Pleasant mid town restaurant.  Good service.  Menu not that extensive or varied  Great bread  Entres at $18+  Wifi    Definitely recommend the Sultan's Delight though.
Make sure you get a proper menu or ordering can be difficult. But it doesn’t matter much as everything on it is incredible. Staff is lovely.
I didn't buy anything but if you need anything this place more than likely has it.
"Ordered from Riviera as I live in the neighborhood. Everything we picked was so delicious!!! Great food, courteous staff!! Everyone should try them!!!"
"Ordered take out that took over an hour. Stayed at the bar to wait and ordered drinks appetizers. The service was not very good.  I had to get up to get the server/bartender a few times. Some of the meals (lasagna, seafood risotto, and chicken parm) were very bland, but I highly recommend the crab cakes and fried calamari - those dishes were delicious."
"The server told us we had to take it to go because we were sharing a fairly large shawarma. Rude, definitely wouldn’t treat a customer like that."
It is of very good quality. The food is good atmosphere. And the staff is very attentive.
I’ve been there twice! I really miss their stirred crabs. It was really good.
"This is a must go to place!!! Amazing food, memorizing interior design, and the plates are awesome!"
This Thai restaurant is so delicious ! The basil fried rice with chicken is incredible! The tom yum soup is also really good. You can find an extensive selection of Thai food here. The decoration is in an elegant style but the price is really reasonable. I will definitely come back.
"Really good food. Service gets a little slow lately but this could be due to restrictions from COVID19. I really like their bread, soups and salad."
Good food and services!
Great food... Very authentic vibe to the area and locally adopted Portuguese culture... Not the fanciest place in the area but absolutely one of the best! Highly recommend it as an intro to Ironbound
Authentic Polish cuisine.  The waiter was a little too Russian but all in all the food and experience was great.  And yes there's seating inside and out.
I don't know why they treat me badly with racism
"Fantastic place. Amazing food and service. I have tried Ethiopian only once before, but this restaurant is sublime. The food is tasty, full of flavor, aromatic, etc. I don't have a favorite because all of the options are good."
Great soup dumplings and Shanghai style appetizers and other dishes (noodles and rice cakes etc).    The pork stew and meatball casserole are also great.
Always delish and great service..
Fast service. Great food. Can't go wrong.
"Place is a gem. Great food and service. Draft beer by the pitcher is super. The pizza was good. Neighborhood bar atmosphere, but with a big room behind the bar. Looks like it starts over 100 people."
"Had the whole red snapper with Spanish potatoes and steamed vegetables, along with the passion fruit sangria food was good, drinks were excellent, service was great, nice atmosphere. Also had the fried calamari for appetizers."
Ordered the Bake & Shark based on reviews and it didn’t hold up too well on delivery. Will stick to roti and doubles next time.
"If you need real bangla food, it's here. Basically all kinds of. From Vorta to biryani."
"Food was very delicious,staff was attentive but utilities were not inviting to say the least ,flies everywhere ..."
Like their all you can eat! Lots of selections and good quality.
"Kevin was a great waiter. Drink bar was a bit slow, and refills on the soup as well. But overall nice. This girl named Stephanie was real nice and really cute. She is the only reason it gets 5 stars, otherwise 4"
Carnitas tacos were lacking flavor. I did not enjoy them.
I am Latina women Puerto Rican and I have to say the food is horrible no taste very expensive for nothing. Please buy else where do not waste your money.
"Boy! I am, so glad we chose to have a girls night out at this wonderful establishment! The owner Median, and staff were all very welcoming and so attentive to our needs. I loved everything down from the hookah to the yummlicious food. I danced the night away to the voice of their live performer. Haven't had this much fun in a while. We shall be back for a second round! Thank you, Beirut!  From a happy customer."
"Usually good pizza. I order all the time but lately my pizza has been arriving all over the box. It still get 4 stars because 85% of the time. I guess my recent order have go to the same person who makes the pizza, and it doesnt set probably"
"The food was okay, calamari was the best but the chicken wasndry and pasta had no taste. The waiter was nice."
"It looked great nice decor, food was delicious"
"Since I moved to this part of Bushwick I’m a regular customer at Tony’s. They deliver pizza always on time an it’s always fresh. Tried a wide variety of dishes from the menu and they always outdo themselves. Great place, the tradition itself says it all. I love Tony’s Pizza!"
Always a great place to relax and enjoy your soup with a good Pasta.
The worst foods in my life!!  Finger sized sushi. Dried out foods.  I feel like I’ve paid quite a money for some left over foods stayed in a refrigerator for weeks that should’ve thrown into a trash can.  They offer a free cocktail for a good review on google or yelp.  I shouldn’t trust the reviews and photos.
The best
"I was expecting more. The design is amazing, the dj was ok. The food was standard for these kinds of places nothing exciting, the ceviche over dressed, not subtle at all. The sushi and scallops were very good. But most of all the service was just odd - drinks took forever and a lot of staff had a ""not my job"" response for requests or questions. I'll give them another try in a few months when they've settled in. For now, it feels like there's room for improvement."
"Nice location, server was doing her best, however the kitchen took over an hour to get our appetizers in, not even mentioning entrees.  Food is good, when it finally arrives.  Very young crowd gathers on Fri evening, barely out of their teens."
"Absolutely, you have to go there if you like trying new types of food. The food is so delicious.  Especially, the Henithe, it is amazing."
"They have free valet parking. The food is good, especially the lobster ravioli and the lasagna. It's like 13 dollars for a cocktail and around 10 bucks for a glass of wine. The waitress was very nice. I would come back again."
Good food always ordered late night
"We enjoyed the food and the service.  Just one thing marred our visit.  I called the restaurant before leaving the house to ask if it was a BYOB and was told, yes, you can bring your own bottle. So we were unpleasantly surprised to find a corkage fee of $10.00 on our bill. When I questioned the waitress, she responded that they always charge this fee. When I told her about my call to the restaurant, she lowered it to $5.00; still left a bad taste."
This was the worst experience. I asked for a steak medium and got a hard piece of rock. When i mentiomed it to the waiter Lopez he rolled his eyes and said thats what the chef gave me. i asked for a Manager and was told the Manager went home. Never again. i wish I could give them 0 stars.
Aloo chole curry had no taste what so ever. Puris were filled with a lot of extra oil. On top of it they charged twice as much as item was listed in menu.
Wonderful place with excellent food! The vibe in here is relaxing with great staff. We decided to sit at the bar and we are glad we did because the bartender there was excellent. Drinks were on point and the food was even better. My wife had the penne and I had the gnocchi. Price was fair for 2 people. Will definitely be coming back here again. Well run establishment. Good job guys!
The lines are long but the food is excellent! Definitely worth the wait.
They have some of the best Peruvian food and are quite filling.
The best (authentic) and most professional Turkish restaurant in New Jersey.
Taiwanese food
The service is very rude
Impeccable service and the food is amazing. Everyone need to go here for authentic Italian cuisine
Their bar sucks  Water DOWN ther drinks
Great service! Mehlika was the best server! Very recommended. Great environment. Mo is the best :)
"Our server Anne was great. Aqueel is the manager and he does a great job. Very sociable and attentive to his customers.  Customer service and food was great. The place accommodated every need no matter how ridiculous the request. For a relaxing and exciting experience, definitely give Imperial 46 a try!  Great food and prices. Highly recommended."
"It’s decently priced for the all the food you get, plus or minus a few dishes you would traditionally get within a set. Can’t complain about the service."
"I was shockingly surprised to find such a proper Italian restaurant next to Central Park.  The atmosphere was very nice, the food was on point and the wine too.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to enjoy the traditional Italian cuisine.    Bravi!"
Food is Great ....service outstanding every time.
Good service and great food. Malaysian dishes were authentic.
This place is good but a rip off.  The menu prices posted online are out of date.  A sausage and mushroom pie should not cost $25.  Food is good but too expensive.  It’s just pizza
"Amazing place, best known for its steamed chicken dimsums. All of their dishes are must try. One of best Nepalese restaurant in Jackson heights"
Very friendly service. Not able to understand English well. I thought I was getting sesame shrimp but got sesame chicken because they didn't have shrimp. Wish I would have known. It was good.
"It depends on who you get as a waiter/ waitress most of the time the staff is terrible. Today I was taking a survey on my experience and my waitress literally snatched the survey machine out of my hand and answered the questions herself. I had a bad experience and she literally took it out my hand and said I had a good experience! Beyond rude. Dear Mr. CEO of Olive Garden please run your cameras on may 26, 2017 at around 8 pm at the Elmhurst location to witness how your employee snatched the survey machine out of my hand!!!!!!!!! I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS LOCATION!!!!!!"
Ordered Via Doordash... called the restaurant to try to edit order and the lady acted if she could care less about me ever ordering again... I used to deliver meat to that restaurant and I promise I never seen anyone eating there... so I I know they need my business
"In search of a new Thai resteraunt to try , me & my fam stumbled upon this place. The food here was good. I ordered the drunken rice with shrimp and calamari as an app. The service was slow, we had to wave someone down whenever we needed something because no one ever checked up on us. Nonetheless , the food was good. However I still have yet to find a better Thai resteraunt than rice & noodles in Montclair  .    -Your local Realtor @Safiyasoldit"
The best restaurant you can find in that area the foods are so delicious the service is oh my God super if you live in New York you need to definitely visit that restaurant for visitors the best restaurant with the high service and the food.I love it and highly recommend to all other peoples
A1 Thai in Woodside
"WORST SERVICE EVER! We had to ask 4 times to make the food order, there were literally 3 tables and 2 people in the bar. They got all our drinks wrong (mixing up Mojito with Margarita, bringing a glass of wine instead of a bottle). When we left, obviously we didn't tip more than 10% and they shout it. Unbelievable. I highly recommend to the owner to fire the waitresses to save this business."
The service was outstanding. it was     non-stop  the food  was also  no-stop
"This place is great the service and food is off the chain. If you want the best service, ask for waitress Chama"
I just ordered to go and food was good.
Nice place!!! Good food …
Their food are delicious!
"Went on a Monday night, it was fairly empty. Our server was nowhere in sight for most of the night. Not likely to go back."
Great venue to sit outside enjoy the fresh air beautiful scenery awesome music and delicious food
Charging automatic 18% gratuities on a 5 person party is not acceptable
Great food and service. Skirt steak is excellent and so is the steamed fish.
"Service was great, food was not as great as I hoped, probably because I ordered unfamiliar items; the tea was good."
"The wait staff was attentive and did a nice job. This place is good for drinks, but the quality of their food has been going downhill for a long time and is definitely not worth the price they charge."
"Food was amazing. One of the best places I have ever ate. The waiters were awesome and got a chance to meet the chef Brian, awesome cook with a great personality. I will definitely be coming back here for brunch."
"Vegetarian restaurant. Nice interior and ambiance.    Flavorful food, however they're a bit on the greasy side. The fried rice was greasy even when asked to go light on the oil. Pad thai was a little too wet to my liking but there was flavor. The same goes for the roti.    If you don't mind the grease and glistening rice, the food is fine."
only restaurant in the peruvian jungle in new jersey
"The ambience and service were top of the line, but I have been to better tasting olive gardens."
The food was delicious the service was incredible everybody was on their game and not missing to be very friendly atmosphere would go back again
"Bought a Groupon, and I did not realize that I had to spend $100 to use a $50 Groupon. I spent $93 and they would not honor the Groupon. Honestly, poor way to do business.  Meal was mediocre at best. Place was empty.  Not surprised.  Will not return nor recommend. You're foolishness cost you way more than $7."
the BEST spread / sashimi ever in NYC. Even better service. Love this place!!! So fresh and friendly. And affordable!!
"Great portions and awesome  tasting food.  Bring seasoning though. For some eeason they don't use seasoning; salt, pepper, Adobe, etc..."
Friendly staff that made me feel right at home. I got the Cuban sandwich and it was absolutely delicious. So happy I got to start my day here.
The best Korean style Chinese food in nyc
"I hate the way the owner treats his workers in front of people!!! Don’t yell at anyone in front of your customers. Smh! Learn how to treat people with respect. ( it hurts seen him yell at one of the workers, in front of me and ny mates.) disappointed."
Been eating here for about 3 years
I don't like going to places where the staff looks and acts like they don't want to be there. It reflects on the food and overall experience. Food really wasn't that bad at all. Overall rating for food is a 7/10. Staff needs to tighten up.
I want to take all my friends here for the juicy soup dumplings!
I love the place but is really hot and takes forever to serve the food. I ordered food at 9:00pm and the the people who came to the next table their food came super quick and it take SOOOO long to serve the drinks and our food came at 9: 40 but it I is really good.
I've eaten here more than a few times... everything has been delicious. Their specials are out of this world. Atmosphere is casual. Staff is very knowledgeable.
"I give 2 starts because I ordered 3 orders of tacos with everything. My tacos were no onions , cilantro a little of lettuce. The meat taste no flavor. The chorizo’s tacos were so different from others places no onion , cilantro or lettuce. Too pricey for what I got . Not happy."
Foods always good
The staff are friendly and the service is great and the food is awesome
Went for cocktails with friends. Would like to go back to try out their food next time
As alway food outstanding service was great and the always make me feel so at home there. NEWS FLASH they just recently added a new dessert it is toasted almond tiramisu  OMG it is to die for one of the most delicious desserts I have had in a long time a must have after dinner I strongly suggest you try it next time you visit enjoy :)
One of the newest restaurants in the neighborhood that have great food and also great lunch specials
Superb me and my girlfriend enjoyed eating here service is great and the view of the city makes its a great spot for a romantic evening dinner.
Quick and tasty.
Very good French restaurant with many great food options. Everything we had here tasted so good. The decor is also very beautiful and the service is excellent. They really take care of their clients in this restaurant. You have to make a reservation here otherwise is very likely you won’t get a table. During holidays they decorate the restaurant very nicely. We will definitely come here again in the future.
Bad food regular Chinese food high prize
"Really good food and amazing employees, especially Cardi and Malika."
Great atmosphere and service.  I didn't really like the flavor of my dinner though
"The soups, bread and salad are very good. Unfortunately they no longer offer a garlic and olive oil option instead of tomato based sauce. However previously you were able to order it and the kitchen staff would oblige. In this visit my friend did just that  what she got was a combination of tons of garlic with oil. It was really bad. My photo shows it and even our server agreed. We were given free desert which was great but I doubt if my friend will be returning."
The food was great and the sangria was delicious. They sat us down right away and the food was delivered timely.
Place was great and delicious food
"An amazing place! We thoroughly enjoyed our night at Benoit. The food was delicious, cocktails tasty, and our service was wonderful. It was very European in that we were able to take our time to enjoy pre-dinner cocktails, savor each course, and not feel rushed. Will definitely be returning!"
"Glad that I can get solid dim sum in the neighborhood! All the dishes were good, and the atmosphere is very clean and modern."
"Just the same as I remembered when I first visited in 2016! A huge selection of hot buffet with lots of Korean dishes. There’s the buffet option and the takeaway dishes option, where you can buy the different things in a ready to go bento. There’s also soup and cold dishes in the fridge, like kimbap, salad, and drinks.    If I worked nearby I would definitely be here every other day!"
Good food! Margarita pizza is very delicious! Eggplant is amazing! Definitely will come back next time. It could be great if the dish size can be larger. 3 people needs to order 4 dishes to get enough.
"I can’t say enough good things about this restaurant! It has been one of our favorites for many years and I love bringing friends and visitors here as well. The salmon is incredible, I also love the red cabbage, the Sultan’s delight and the appetizers (eggplant and cacik). The bread is always fresh and warm. We have been ordering a lot of takeout during COVID and its great although we miss the ambiance and the great people that work here. Thanks ABA!"
Bad service when my family order the food was cold we also ask for to reheat the food and the rice was dry sorry but 1 star
"Batura was no bad, buy the chicken rice were great"
The food is very fresh and delicious. If you don't try this food you missing a great meal.
"Food, price and service very good. Is recommended for New York"
Some of the best food I ever ate
"The waiter was exceptional, attentive,  suggested the meals and desserts of the day. Friendly and the food was delicious"
Really great restaurant! The food is amazing - authentic Mediterranean Turkish food. It tastes like home. The only thing I would change: please play authentic music!
Best bang for your buck
"Huge plates, Street tables right on 57th Street."
We went with folks who have been going here for over  40 years.  Good and service was very good. Arther Avenue bread is still the world's best.
First time eating there. I really enjoyed the food and drinks. And the atmosphere and service was on point. I will return and will recommend everyone to try it..
"Lovely place to go and GREAT salmon. Get the combo meal on the weekday specials menu. It's $16 for more food that either my friend or I could eat. All super tasty, too."
Authentic cantonese cuisine.  Best in NJ
Great food
great place. Mario is awesome.
"Great service (thank you Noah!), great atmosphere, and great food. What more can you ask for? My wife and I split the mixed grill and sides. Everything was cooked right and service was prompt."
"Food was excellent, but the maintenance is terrible. As soon as I stepped in the whole place had a weird smell. The floor was dirty so as the table. We had to move to another table by ourselves as there was no staff to assist. Bathroom floor was wet and tissues all over the floor. I guess Olive Garden doesn't even care much to this location. If this continues to go on then sorry olive garden."
Wonderful place. Great menu.  Seating is tight. Emily was our super server. Definitely will return. Suggest reservations.
It's a cool local spot with an extensive drink and food menu.. get there for the happy hour with $5 beers and bunch of other drink specials.    They had the 6-piece wing special for happy hour as well. The soy garlic is very tasty and crispy!  Their chicken wing business is on point!
I need a chance to work
"I have stopped going to olive garden long back. I was forced to go this time to use my gift card and boy it did disappoint as expected. Filthy place as shown. Food was below average. I just couldn't eat it. Wasted 80% of it and never bothered packing as I know I won't like it. The only good part was the desert. Other than that it was a dud. This is my last visit to olive garden. If I get a olive garden gift card next time, I will donate it away."
"Amazing food and great service. We were visiting NY from Calgary, Canada. I read reviews of this place online and decided to go for lunch. It was worth the walk. The servers were attentive and courteous. Would definitely recommend to friends visiting NYC."
I celebrated my wife's birthday and the staff did a wonderful job and gave her an unforgettable experience.  Great job Czen..  And the food was amazing  
"A little more expensive than I usually opt for, but great selection of menu items, presentation, and service"
The Food is great and service is awesome.
We came here for lunch. The food and the service were really good. I recommend!
"Good food but quite expensive, I didn’t like that they forced me to tip a specific amount with the bill. I never saw this in New York City."
The restaurant is much worse than it used to be. The owner and chef have changed. The prices have gone up and the portions have gotten ridiculously smaller. It looks like it's designed for a 3 year old. Yesterday we made an order and at home we saw that only 4 small pieces of shish kebab were included in the portion. All.! We will not go to this restaurant again and will not order anything. I will warn all my friends and acquaintances not to do business with this restaurant.
Warm welcoming friendly. Staff helpful. Excellent food quality.  Freshly made food and New York Latin flavor. Clean.
"Good food for a fair price. Unlimited soup, salad, and breadsticks. Service has always been professional. Looking forward to going back  …"
"Check No: 33719  Table No: 252  Date: 08/14/2021 07:44 PM  Server: Atoosa E  The worst service I have ever had.  This was uncalled for.  One must treat customers as one would treat their mother.  Never again will we eat at this restaurant.  When someone spits in your tea cup and thinks you didnt notice is bad.  We must be nice to one another and present the food based on the rules of the restaurant, the soup was cold, the tea had spit in it, did not get offered desert and the service was bad."
A go-to for my family when we're in the neighborhood. Always good.
Awesome pasta options. Truly an excellent dinner option in the city
My salmon was excellent.  The service was superb.  I will definitely be a regular.
Delicious food and always prepared quickly.  The only place I go to for Chinese food.
Elizabeth's best pupusas
Favorite restaurant in NYC!!!!! best food and best staff
"Nice place, very busy at night time. Food was good, very cheap as well. We had 4 people only paying 15 for a full dinner"
"Lovely place, great service  …"
Average food n service - ambiance was pretty good
Hands down the best dim sum in all of central NJ
I don’t frequent Olive Garden. This is only my second time going to one aside from the one in Garden city. The food wasn’t bad. Except we had to change our table. There were several micro ants on my side of the table . I almost didn’t notice. That why I gave it a 3. We got an apology which is great from the waiter but tbh the Mgr should have offered their apologies. I still felt a bit uncomfortable but I wasn’t dining alone. Overall it was ok.  The prices are decent and the lunch menu is good.
Everything was amazing! All of the dishes I had were delicious and the ambiance is so fun. Highly recommend!
Best pizza ever! I never knew pizza could be this delicious. My mother and sister both agree! If you have someone visiting you take them here and I guarantee they will be impressed!    Also a great spot for vegans! I highly recommend the vegan Buffalo pizza even if you eat meat!
"We had them cater for a small part of ten.  The food came hot, and plenty.  Everyone raved about the selections.  The person who retired, is a regular, said the food we got tasted just as great as sitting down.  Look forward to visiting back in person."
"Very nice am Queen o and sizeable portions! Viv Thai was exactly what I needed after a night out on Broadway. We got the Red curry and the Queen of Siam basil, both great options."
"I went to that restaurant with 2 other people. We order chicken roll, sausage hero and sausage roll. Everything was blend without taste. We did not enjoy our lunch. . Looks like they heat up the food in the microwave. The chicken roll had a big slab of chicken inside, tasteless . ZThe sausage was like rubber...    EWithout deadening"
"Took my girlfriend here for our anniversary and it didn’t lead up to expectations to say it kindly. The bread was gross. The drinks taste like Hudson River water, the calamari is better at the Olive Garden, and the steak didn’t have much flavor. I left almost as hungry as when I sat down to eat. The only thing the place has going for them is a nice wait staff"
Crab is fresh and good taste!
Food was very good.  Highly recommend the stuffed cheese burger!!
"Absolutely stunning place, great drinks. Food was just ok though. Menu was not captivating, nor food memorable. Staff was very attentive-perhaps too attentive. Not to be nit-picky, as I’d prefer attentive service than not, I just felt like I could barely carry on a conversation without being interrupted every few minutes. Overall lovely place."
"A great place to go. The food is special, and the Mujaddara Croquettes are amazing."
"Worst experience of my life, this is not a Greek place anymore. Cold soup, cold rice, bad quality seafood. Lousy service boring environment.  Back in the days this used to be captain Greek one of the best spots in Astoria. Will never come back"
I'm hooked on their breakfast
"This place is a hidden gem - if you're in the mood for a cheap, Korean meal (particularly great for lunch cause it's very much grab and go) this is the place to be. Pictured below is the kimchi fried rice and bulgogi beef. It's also 5% off your bill if you pay in cash and a $15 credit card minimum."
"Great food, very tasty and finger-licking. Very busy place for take out (upto 1.5 hr) so order ahead of time. I like the punjabi dishes that best. The Indo-Chinese dishes were just okay. We have already ordered 3 times just this month from Delhi Garden, that is how great it is!"
Delicius Amazonic Peruvian food!
"Good service, very good food."
I love this place. Very nice people.  Very delicious food. Good prices too and portions too! They also provide free Buddhist literature which I enjoy. Definitely my favorite place to eat.
My favorite sushi spot! Staff is amazing very welcoming and they always have a big smile when you walk in. #myfavsushispot
Received warm and great.service from the host and servers here. He seated us in the deck which was great because the weather was beautiful and sunny today so loved the natural light. The food was really good and I was very happy that I got my oeuffs de maurette (a Burgundian dish made with red wine sauce). Highly recommend!
"Read the menu..memorize the price cause when u get the bill big surprise!. Had bolognese rigatoni. Macaroni was hard as a rock, couldn't even eat. A lettuce salad was so overpriced. Took clients out for lunch 96.00 for 3 people and thought prices were different but did not want to say anything in front of clients. No alcohol. Called restaurant later in day, Owner was supposed to call me back. Never did. Will never return."
"Very nice restaurant, the service was spectacular and food was delicious. The alcoholic beverage were well mixed and not stingy with the alcohol. The servers were polite and precise with the orders."
Great place to eat !! You will never be disappointed!  Filet Mignon Tips they Melt in your mouth 
Sorry. Pizza wasa failure this time around. Good in the past. Tasted old and salty.
Great place to pick up galaktoboureko.
The Mac & cheese & fries was good. The wings were gross and the entree courses were not its best. Can say it is not worth much. The drinks were regular. My partner was also not impressed. Even the looks of the place I know it’s covid but the spot look questionable and old looking. Probably won’t  go again. Good thing didn’t take the person here months ago for their birthday they would of been disappointed.
Delicious food and atmosphere was great. Our waitress was very lovely. Definitely recommend this place.
"Great staff and very good food.  It is BYOB, so bring a few bottles of wine and your party will have a great evening."
"Freshly made pizza, amazing soup, great food!"
Was at a private dinner upstairs. Terrific ambiance and food.
"Just left my son and fiancee's engagement brunch party. Everything was perfect. Loved the space, the food and the staff. So happy we had a sunny day to enjoy the terrace!!Could not have asked for more. Highly recommend."
"Great Place!  had a fun night and the service was exceptional!  The owners greeted me themselves, and to mention the food was amazing as well! 5 out of 5!"
I've been going to this place for many years and the quality has stayed excellent. It is loud so not great for a romantic date but with a group of friends it's perfect. I always get the stuffed lobsters. Sooo good. The shrimp in garlic to start is delicious. The homemade potato slices are also excellent. The sangria is cheap and does the job. Fast friendly service every time. Free parking in the lot across the street.
The restaurant itself has a nice aesthetic and the food is very well presented but definitely doesn't live up to expectations flavor/price wise. The lobster is fried in the shell so the coating ends up staying there and the waffles didn't have anything going for them without the (very good) caramel or syrup. Worth a revisit for the dinner menu since we did go too early for some of the other options.
My go to place when I want to have a true Dominican meal! They make one of the best mofongos you'll ever have! The juices are one of a kind! Love them!! …
Simply the best place for fresh seafood and they have fresh fish. My family loved shopping here and found fresh fish that  they normally eat back in India
"Amazing pizza & food, and overall experience. We frequent here a lot - we’re regulars! Service is always outstanding ~ ask for Eddie, he will take the greatest care of you!  Thanks, Edison Pizza!"
"Old, run down service slow. Burgers were good though"
Delicious - veal appetizer is . Worth the wait! …
Great food. Great hookah. Great atmosphere in general! Definitely recommend
Delicious food! I'll be back!!
"Pastai incredible food, they prepare one of the best sangria. The prosciutto it’s perfect . It’s a good place to have a date or go with friends, also the staff are so friendly and attentive."
"I ordered 2 trays of Chicken Biryani for an event and it was super delicious.  The food was well cooked, chicken tender and juicy and the dish had a nice little spicy kick to it.   It came with a tray of salad and yogurt chutney. Food was ready on time and one of the staff even helped me out to my car.  Highly recommended."
"It was average food, poor service,  comparable prices."
I'll be back  Soon
I was at the restaurant for a birthday party.
"8/13/22 Update:  Sadly, ever since Covid struck there are staffing shortages therefore, no more outside dining. Truly miss it and wish they would bring it back.    In season, this is the place to be. Outside patio with a view of the water. Live music Friday and Saturday evenings. Seafood dishes abound and are to die for!  Staff is experienced and friendly. Handicap accessible."
Neat and clean place. Impressive system to place orders. Quick and easy checkout. Friendly staff and delicious food. Reasonable prices.
You go for the Pierogis but stay for the Ukrainian beer! It’s the perfect comfort food and also great for a night out with friends!    You can’t skip it if you’re in town for a couple of days.
Love it  Nice place   Good food  Good prices  Bring you own
"probably the best Turkish restaurant around. It's very delicious, I like it, I'll go here again. services are also great...    they have pretty tasty food here and i will eat there again, highly recommended.    my favorite is mixed grill!"
"One of the best Thai places in HK. Good food, fun atmosphere, and friendly wait staff. 100/100."
"We had a great lunch, I am turkish and i was very glad to find this restaurant and ate delicious foods. Also staff was very nice, thanks to all.  P. S. :The pictures are from christmas time of 2021"
"This place is wonderful, they treated me wonderfully. The food reminded me of the dishes my grandmother used to make me many years ago. Very warm atmosphere.    Thanks to. Daniel, Sergio and Miguel in case excellent attention"
good but not the food you get in Shanghai
Karen is a friendly outgoing hostess and Coleen is a great waitress.  We eat here frequently and enjoy their pleasant personalities.
no chicken doner? lamb was burn and chewey and tasteless. Not worth $20 by any standards. 4 thumbs down. garbage lunch spot.
"I'm so glad this place opened! It's a family business, they're incredibly friendly, the menu is huge (and includes lots of Mexican specialties), the food is great, the portions are massive, and the space is really nice (including their outdoor seating). This is the kind of homey, cozy restaurant that seems to be disappearing from the city (RIP Teresa's in BK Heights), so I'm so happy to see it in the Slope. Please support this great business!"
I really enjoyed this out of the way restaurant. Food and atmosphere were really great.
"We were waiting table for 40 minutes, it’s not a big deal. BUT we waiting a waitress to take an order for another 25 and she took an order only because we asked a busboy to get the waitress, she forgot to add sushi to the order and we got our drinks when we finished the food. It was one of my favorite places of Asian food. First time ever, I so disappointed."
Very good authentic chilean food. Ceviche is very good.
For the last decade their food has not changed and is always amazing!  Consistency.
"Love it! We have been to many Shawerma restaurants in NY and NJ, this one is so far the best one, delicious chicken and beef shawerma. Definitely we will be back to eat there."
What a great Chinese spot in the middle of time square. Food was great. Try the soup buns dumplings.    Feedback: The table linens smelled like they needed to be dried properly
"Adequate franchise Italian. No complaints but it wasn't exactly special, either. Server was attentive and kind. Parking isn't the greatest at this site. You pretty much have to walk a block or so from wherever you park to the restaurant entrance."
"Delicious baked chicken, although they don't pay me ""payola"""
Very delicious different varieties of parathas and Indian fast food.
While I understand that during dinner rush servers can get overwhelmed and be slightly less attentive than they would be during other hours it was hard to barely have any service at all. Our table was never cleared so when our main course arrived I had to pick up and move our plates around and then take the plates from the runner and place them where they needed to go. Either more staff or better management is required.
They make a tuna melt the way is supposed to be made. Generous portions.  Definitely coming back.
I went to Mariachi 2 years ago with my dad and I loved the food and the ambiance. But today we ordered their food again and my chicken tacos were so underwhelming. They came with super tiny corn tortillas and the chicken fell out. The chicken was really bland and dry. The rice and beans looked good but when I tasted them I didn't like them either; everything was so bland. I was so disappointed by this meal. The only thing that tasted good was the guacamole.
"Food and service is always solid. Great flavors. Banchan tastes great with generous portions. You'll want Banchan for appetizer, entree and dessert.  My only real complaint is while the food tastes great the prices are a little higher than even spots in Edison. I've had their sashimi appetizer and the fish is good but not notable"
Will be going back soon .we had our Christmas party catering done there this year .VERY GOOD home made just like our own family .  Same name but no relation. .
I ordered their shrimp taco with the special sauce. OmG this Taco with sauce was Amazing!! I will be returning. The girl at the counter was super friendly. Must try their special Taco with the sauce. I will be coming back!!
Love their pizza
Food is so so so Good .. must try lamb chops its ridiculously delicious...
Food was decent service good views are greT
Peking Duck! For 1 or 2 people. Very decent portion.
"Not only was the food wonderful, but the service staff was terrific and very kind to my grandsons."
Love This Restaurant and The Menu They Have...  A Good Family Restaurant...
Great food. Great service. Great ambiance.    Upland continues to be steadfast on its delivery of all 3 variables which is quite difficult for most NYC restaurants to maintain. A lovely experience!    Don’t miss the little gem salad (big enough for 2) and margarita pizza!
My  breakfast entre was a specialty some kind of hash which was refreshingly not greasy at all but bland in flavor.  Would try again but skip that entree
"My husband and I were visiting family in New York and stopped by Boishaki before driving 4 hours south. The restaurant was clean and organized and the food was freshly cooked. The staff were also incredibly friendly and helpful. I ordered beef tehari, chicken roast, and samosas to-go and it was the perfect meal to break our fast with when we arrived home. 10/10, highly recommend."
"An excellent place  MEAT CHICKEN SEAFOOD FISH All in one place, excellent service "
Amazing food and service. One of our fav places to go. And they offer an extension gluten free menu which is fantastic for our family.
Beet peruvian food ever  Julian was great
"Great food!! Love the decor, great music always playing; great service, it is going to be one of my regular spots, for sure."
Food was a disappointment my Nona would've hated it here and the atmosphere was horrible so loud barely any leg room... atlwest the service was pretty good
"On a regular day,  (Not a holiday, or new years) You can expect long wait times, confused staff, mixed up orders, and under cooked rice.  But the people are nice."
"Very delicious food, excellent service, authentic flavors."
Bar always have a good crowd of people. Food is tasty too. I usually order take out from here.
Today we went to celebrate we are first time home owners we needed to sit 8 people we waited about 30 minutes which is understandable due to circumstances but the service was amazing the waitress was great wish i got her name food was fresh and service was 100% great highly recommended  …
"I got the wrong order, instead of drunken noodles I got egg rolls. The egg rolls tasted like a used gym sock and the curry had undercooked potatoes and it tasted under seasoned. BF said ""Worst Curry in NJ"" . There's better Thai restaurants including one called IMM Thai not too far away. Go there instead. Save yourself."
"We were a party of 8.  We were put in the party room when another party was going on.  Was way to noisy.  Made reservations 2 days in advance.  Could have put two tables together?????.  Food was good though.  If we go back , we will only go in main room"
"Not coming back until this restaurant is under a new administration , service is bad,  I be coming to this restaurant for years , but now the service is wacke"
"Exquisite food and very well attended by  Even though they pay poorly, as the song says. I recommend the place, the atmosphere is warm like being in our land in the same way the food."
"Amazing places , the food ommmgg is so good  Buddha is everything i love it… thank you Kenji .He is the person that every business should have, the tea explains gives you options, a wonderful experience. …"
Food was ok.. Lacking flavor
Very relaxing atmosphere. Friendly staff  big selection of veggie meals. Not to salty
"Food was excellent but I wish I had sat on the restaurant side rather than the bar side. Never been to an Italian restaurant without a wine list, but I guess there is a first for everything. Service was a bit slow."
The closest Indian Restaurant to me my favorite dish is the mushroom curry!
Great food and service. We all had a wonderful time!
One of my favorite restaurants! It sure is getting pricey from when I first stared visiting this place 10+ years ago but the Lomo Saltado and Peruvian chicken are both staples anyone passing by will love and remember
My wife and I went for lunch.The food was excellent but the service was very slow. It took us over an hour to get our food I would have given them 3 Stars if it wasn't for the food.
The table was dirty  we asked for lemonade and they told us there wasn’t any and then we ordered cokes and then they told us there’s no cokes and then order a lemonade and then they brought the lemonade out and they’re like really really sour like a lemon  The pizza was also a really disgusting I ordered a soup and the soup is cold you also had some mozzarella sticks in the mozzarella sticks where hard and the bread crumbles did not stick up we also ordered a pasta and it was really terrible
"We go here often, food is great and prices are good."
My favorite Malaysian restaurant.
Bad service and they wouldn’t replace the food I didn’t want.
Delicious French focused items with a beautiful outdoor space in the back. The staff was very welcoming and helpful to our young family
Great restaurant delicious food and excelent service !!  By the way Mr. Ugur and Mr. Sercan thanks for everything :)
Beautiful restaurant on the Hudson.
"Super surprised!!  Ordered their Tofu over rice. BLOWN AWAY!!Amazing!! Not your typical tofu breaded cubes they actually fried the tofu into thin Strips. Looked crazy real, I had to ask one of my meat eater coworkers to try it first! LOL because it looks like chicken!!I confirmed it was tofu!! Large portions for the price. Will be back soon!! (:"
"Great! Great! Great time! I truly enjoyed the atmosphere, the music and the food. We had a surprise party for a friend and the waiter (Malik) was the absolute BEST! I cannot say enough about the customer service and the attention we received. And the PainKillers!!! I'll definitely be back."
Great food presentation everyone very friendly. Service is great. Great entertainment too
"Food was awesome, staff is very friendly."
Food is good
"Best Mexican food on the Island. Drinks r great, great atmosphere"
The food was superb - simply brilliant. The ambience is extravagant and special. A visit is guaranteed worthwhile. The manager Henry was extremely accommodating and helpful. Thank you for this culinary experience.
"We have been to the Black Barn cafe in the Chelsea Market and loved it so we decided to try the restaurant. The decor is great, in the summer, they have a small Palio open for dinner in the front. There is the Tavern and the main restaurant (in the back) we we were seated by the open kitchen. Our waiter was awesome. The food was pricey but delicious. One negative: the wine is very expensive and all the lower priced ones were out of stock. A go to but for an occasion."
"The room are decent (even of a Little bit crowded and kitch) and the waiter was very kind. Appetizers were good. Maybe I was the unlucky One, but my Lamb casseruole was definetively not so good. The meat was too cooked, and the sauce/side untasty.  Maybe you should Simply try something else..."
Good food  good service …
Best restaurants I drive from the Bronx to queens 35 minutes  paying toll gas just to come here and get my pasta 100% recommended  mr Dennis alway got a positive actitud second reason why I alway Combe back to this restaurant
I have been going here since the remodeling and the food is even better now. Keep the great food coming..
"Absolutely horrible experience. The server was despondent and unprofessional. My family and I were not offered refills on our drinks, salad, or soup. We felt rushed and like we were a burden to the waitress. I will NEVER again visit this location. Her attitude with my family made this such an awful experience that I felt like crying during my entire meal. I hope no family ever has to experience what my family just experienced here."
Enjoyed the chicken curry
Cold beer
I love the place...My last visit I was a little upset.  The rice in my Paella was kinda burned
"Awesome friendly service, good portions for price that was very tastey"
"Great food and atmosphere, also very nice staff. Awesome prices will definitely recommend and visit again."
"Delicious food!! I got fried calamari/wings, will recommend. Also, I ordered delivery which the food was fresh and on time. Very please with the service."
"It's overrated !! We ordered the mix grilled platter (Chicken and Lamb Shish Kabab), but it was just okay and nothing special about it. The meat was completely tasteless and not juicy as it's supposed to be. Dry and tasteless!    There may be other dishes that are probably better, but the mix platter was a disappointment.    The place itself is nice in terms of an experience closely tied to the Yemenis culture."
One of the few good bars that have tasty dessert.This place is comfortable and well known to the community. Service is friendly.
it was great! I think Jjajangmyeun here was better than korean's! I'll visit again!
the chicken was great but the rice was bland other then that it was great
"One of the best in Flushing.  Clam soup is the best, but today they gave me wrong sizes. But I will endorse this place"
"A2B is really good restaurant, I ordered Paneer Kadhai ( reference by Rajesh) , that’s was amazing"
"Great value for the price. This little gem in the heart of Elizabeth is a must try. If you want true authentic Mexican food, don't hesitate. Nothing like a family owned business ran with LOVE. The food is a true home cooked meal. Everytime we come each dish just gets better. Thank you for the perfect service.  P.S. $1 for 3 churros :)"
"I met friends here for Happy Hour on a Monday…. We had a blasttttt. Food was DELICIOUS, drinks ummm mmmm GOOD and the Dj kept us dancing in our seats!!!! I couldn’t believe my drink ( Bahama Mamma) was $5 dollars. I also ordered Stew Chicken with Rice n Peas n Cabbage also $5. We also were given a pitcher of Rum Punch…. I will be returning "
The food was delicious.  I have no words to describe how delicious the oxtail flatbread and the ackee and shrimp flatbread was.  Our server was superb and there was always someone clearing the extra plates and utensils to always make room.  I loved that the wait for food wasnt long.  I will return!
"Visit many times, will come again for sure!"
I enjoy this place every time I go!
"The Staff Is Friendly, Live Singing,The Food Is Amazing And Cooked To Perfection, I Have And Will Continue To Enjoy Bareli's For Years To Come"
"I was so disappointed with the food and service. Poor food quality and was not cooked well.The service was really terrible, on top of that the staff are very rude. Not recommended."
"Delicious! Highly recommend, authentic Italian and impeccable service. Everyone was very kind and accommodating."
Service was ok. Short ribs was okay. I had the Peruvian chicken. It was giving me canned sauce and wayyyy to spicy. The wine smelled like pure rubbing alcohol. Glasses smelled funky. I won't be back. It was super empty and another couple was sat right next to us idk why because they had so much space. I heard all of their convo so annoying. All in all it was not great but waitress was nice and gave us free pretzel.
"Great service , good food. We like the place"
The food was good. We didn’t have to wait a or to be seated.  The waitress put on the receipt 18% of gratuity without even asking. Be careful.  9/10
Awesome place.  Super interesting menu.  Really excellent.  Very small space.  Be prepared to meet people.
"This place has great service, atmosphere, and out of this world food. We had the sangria, super bock (Portuguese beer), paella, beef and chicken combo, as well as the Portuguese steak with two eggs. Everything was delicious! Wasn't my first time here, and most definitely won't be my last. "
"Generous portions, good for keto-diet people (i.e., lots of meat). The atmosphere and service are very casual (like a diner), but food is good and represents the Yemani people well. Can't decide if I like this place or Al Bawani across the street better for Middle Eastern food?"
Good fine place in south bronx
Delicious food with awesome presentation. Lovely and warm ambiance with awesome relaxing music with amazing service.  Do give the cheesecake a try my favorite dessert.
The food is good but sometimes the dim sum is cold. Hit or miss and the carts don’t do a great job at hitting every table
They charge for bread.  What kind of Restaurant  they charge for bread  Amazing  will never go back service  very poor  and the food.   Was not that great
"Worse experience at a restaurant, terrible service, terrible food, extremely overpriced, rushed us to get out of the restaurant, massively overpriced tip, staff were all sat around doing nothing, please save your money and go anywhere else!"
"Good service. Food is not authentic, but not bad."
"Highly recommend! The food is delicious and the ambiance is wonderful. They have true outdoor seating, meaning, you can sit outside in their outdoor patio area and don't have to sit out in the street or a parking lot like some of the other restaurants have had to do during COVID. Also, the servers are all wearing face coverings and following COVID guidelines. P.S. The ginger calamari is delish!"
"Had an AMAZING party this past Saturday with over 40 people. The staff is very accommodating, cocktails were incredible, the food was brought out at a great pace and every dish was absolutely delicious and was presented beautifully. The sushi is out of this world! The staff was very welcoming, attentive, and knowledgeable. The smoothest and best party I have had thanks to Buddha Bar New York! I would recommend over and over again."
"Cheap and cheerful restaurant in china town. Don’t expect any frills but do expect great soup dim sum  The place is pretty unkept so it needs a proper clean up. One starter, two main courses, and two drinks adds up to $40 (but cash only). …"
Sushi and food absolutely delicious. Highly recommended.  Service is great . Place is clean. Price is great.
Food is top notch and service was great!
I love this place the food is always fresh and the service and drinks amazing
"William was very kind, a unique experience, very tasty food, thanks for your good attention, I recommend it"
"Mom and pop place that is a hidden gem. Nothing like their crispy pork belly, massaman curry, and any style of rice. They come thru time after time  …"
"I ordered food from this spot for the first time last night and I must say they did not disappoint. It was absolutely delicious!!! It was seadoned very well and you get a large portion of food. Also, the staff was very nice and helpful. I will definitely be back!"
"We had a great experiance. As close to time square as it is we did question whether food would be good, hands down food was top notch. The staff was fun we had surf and turf for two great delivery. I would recommend it just for the tableside service. Dont be afraid to come on in on a cold rain day and let the folks here take care of you, and take care of you they will!"
Yummy food and great service.
Great food and even more great bread sticks! We went to celebrate for a birthday and we were lucky enough to get a little room to ourselves. I couldn't ask for more! This picture is the chicken Alfredo. Definitely recommend it!
"This used to be one of our favorite places to go as a family. But over the years, we noticed that the options have gotten smaller. The place is still clean, and staff are friendly and accommodating though."
Really extraordinary home made greek food.  Nice place and the people very kind!!
I have heard of this place by so many people I had to try it myself. They were right. Amazing food!!! I tried the house rice with Lomo. Delicious! The can adjust their food options to your liking. I tried a Nutcraker that was really good but a little pricy for the size. Great and fast customer service. Will definetly come back!
"Awesome food. I had some wakamole, with some chips. My grandson had chicken tenders, with fries. Fries were amazing, tenders were good. Chips were crunchy, and the best of all, the wakamole was the best i have had in a long time. In all, this place was so good.  …"
Tried combo dim sum for dinner which comes with 2 pieces of each dim sum I wanted. I liked them better than golden dragons. Atmosphere and service can be improved. Entire hall seems to be really dusty also. I want to try different dim sums for lunch time.
Amazing fusion of Mexican and Peruvian dishes! Great atmosphere! Truly a hidden gem
"The food is very good, exotic dishes from the jungle of Peru. Unique in the area. It has a store in CLIFTON, with a super nice atmosphere and very well decorated."
Pretty good. Liked the decor and the food. A bit pricey but worth it for once.
They have lots of portion and side dishes.
6 Years of Exellence! Favorite Shushi spot in all of NYC.
"The don't respect customers. When I checkout, the waiter automatically added 17% tips on top of total charges (include 17% tips on Tax) without even asking. I don't mind 17% but they should ask at least."
Their naan and chicken kebab is to DIE for and I get them every time I return to the city. But dude their prices are kinda atrocious... I understand it's the inflation but I really pray the prices will come down.
So i went there for Aftar buffet. I liked the way they served the appetizers first and then let you pray Salah and after Salah the actual food. Food was not that bad. The only thing i didn't like was it was a very small place and there were so many people. Because of heat and suffocation inside we could not enjoy the food and we had to leave early...
"The worst service I have ever experienced in my life.  We asked for a drink menu, the restaurant simply didn’t have it! The useless server just actioned the few options clearly not caring if we were interested or not.  We just stood up and left. I will never return!"
"We had veggie ramen and uni ramen. The veggie ramen soup was miso-based and a bit too salty, while the uni ramen tasted like creamy pasta."
Great atmosphere the food was great was a vibe. Had the Pad Thai with shrimp but finished it so quick I forgot to take a pic.
Awesome all day dim sum and authentic Chinese food.
The customer service is amazing. Everyone is super nice. The pricing on everything is reasonable and the food is so good.
"The food was delicious, drinks were perfect. My daughter love the oreo dessert, she said it was best dessert she’s ever had. Thank you."
You can taste the quality
I hadn't been to the restaurant since it changed hands. Everything was delicious!
Other reviews describing it as hole in the wall are totally right. They are also right about the great food and friendly service. Lots of locals there for lunch and if I was a local I would be a regular as well.  Also probably the cheapest meal we will have in the city.
"I remember the salad being better. I did enjoy my endless soup, salad & bread sticks however just didn't seem as good as I once thought it all was ( years ago different location). The staff was all very friendly and the restaurant was very clean."
My family and I were in search of a good Dim Sum restaurant near us and we were so excited to find one. We went on Sunday morning and it was very busy but definitely worth the wait! The dim sum were delicious and everything tasted so fresh! We will definitely come back soon!
Pastai is a super cute dinner spot in Chelsea. I've walked past it countless times so one night a friend and I decided to finally try it. I got the bucatini for an entree and tiramisu for dessert. Both were simply amazing. The portions were a bit small but it's NYC so it's to be expected. The server gave us a complimentary round of shots after dinner which was much appreciated.
Great place
Food cold
"I used to go to this place for years when I worked over in Iselin. What happened to Meemah?  The place has changed since they got new ownership. They are not friendly. The greeter was unwelcoming to me and 1st time guests. The waiter was rude and snatched the menu from my hand and more over they over peppered my food because the food was too spicy to eat. And the quality of the chicken was spongy. I would never go there again. If I could give them Zero stars I would.  So sad, it used to be nice."
Delicious Ecuadorian breakfast!
Food is great and service is wonderful.
Amazing place. Atmosphere and food. Outta bounds
"I have been coming here with my friends and family for a while now. The food is great! Consistent, every time we come!  Great people, Great Food, Clean and Great service! Stop by and check them out! Recommend ...chicharrones de pollo sin hueso(popcorn chicken) or the barbecue chicken!"
"Authentic food, best I've tasted in a while. Wonderful people. I come here at least once a week."
"Food's pretty good, servers mostly nice, service is consistent, prices not too bad.  Have returned more than once, will go back again."
Wonderful place. Great service and great food. Can't say enough how much I love it here.
Good food and homely environment.
La comida omg was so delicious
"Don't come to the NY/NJ area without stopping here! If you CRAVE authentic halal Pakistani cuisine, then this is your place. The restaurant is cozy and warm. The service is excellent. Saddam was waiting on us and did an great job; was fast, polite, and attentive. We ate so much food, and the bill was very reasonable. We'll be coming back for sure!"
They have some quality food and the seating area is pretty quiet. We liked their food and my kids enjoy it. I strongly recommend this restaurant. The price of their foods are little high.
3 of us dined. Beers $6. We had 5. Two Pina colada 12$ we had 2. Ordered shrimp fried rice and chicken lomein. Food was very sweet  like  It was cooked in sugar water and the bunjal gizzard ..well hmmm .bill was 123$ includes service charge .  A very terrible experience.staff was nice ..place was clean...but food and price was horrible..No reason ever to go back there.
"I've always liked this place.  There was a huge price discrepancy between menu online and actual price.  I know theres inflation and all but come on.... for example, online showed 12 bucks for the pho, then you get there they tell you its $20. Or when you expect vietnamese sandwich for 8.95 but you get there its $12.   Im not as mad about the actual price than the price disparity.  Ridiculous."
"Our server Mimi was professional, efficient & excellent. She refilled our water/drinks w/o any of us asking. We tipped her generously bcuz of her service."
Burgers are still great!!!
"I have been here numerous of times and each time was a great experience. You can taste the freshness of the food. All the salads are always extra crispy and fresh. Their chicken parm is amazing! Everything about this restaurant is excellent. The portions are so big. You pay a decent price and get left overs, not too many places you can actually say that about. The owner is very friendly and always there greeting you. I would recommend this place to everyone!!"
Best bangali restaurant in Newyork..we impressed for their food and behavior…go for it… …
"The best place in Staten Island.Delicious food,great service,nice music.Also,good place to celebrate any anniversaries,weddings,birthdays.I recommend to visit this Restaurant and spend good time."
"Way overpriced: $120 for a 2.5-pound steamed live fish (marble goby fish), $68 for the lobsters with ginger and scollions."
"Great place. A bit on the pricier end, especially when considering the small serving size. The food and service were great overall, and worth a visit!"
Delicious food and good service!  We dine at Hunkar very often.
All the food we order was very delicious. The restaurant was busy so the servers were in a fast pace and may seem little rushing but it was understandable for us.
Really good!
Went to eat with the family & every meal was super delicious! The name fits perfect.
"The Penang curry chicken is to die for. Get a side of roti, dip it in the sauce, it will melt in your mouth and you've gone to heaven. Warning, spicy ahead. But so, so good."
Great place to enjoy Turkish food. Has lots of options in both vegetarian and non vegetarian. Must try are tge kebabs and the Turkish pide. Turkish tea on the side will be great too.
"I highly recommend this restaurant . The staff are very professional and friendly especially Celik. You would think that the staff own the restaurant. Food is amazing.  I love their soups, appetizers, and spinach."
"Enchanting garden, atmosphere draws you in as soon as you enter. Two floors of candlelit cosiness, excellent food, wonderful and friendly service. A great bar downstairs to have a digestif over candlelight. A wonderful night"
"One of the best Asian fusion food place I’ve been to. I would definitely say it’s better than Sagar. I’ve personally had the pleasure to meet the owner too and he’s actually such a genuine and cool owner. And finally, the food is to die for. Best Asian fusion Bengali food I ever had!"
"Best place ever! Food is delicious, service is fast!"
Excellent attention
"Amazing service and food, we had a beautiful view"
This is absolutely the worst all you can eat place ive every been to. Ridiculous rules eg. I cant share food with my 3 year old ddaughter...so if my baby ask me..daddy let me taste that..ill have to pay an additional charge for her..yup your reading right...oh an if you leave any rice on your plate...that's an extra charge as well..
I’ve been here twice now and it’s been spectacular both times. Reasonably priced fresh produce. Friendly staff and a warm atmosphere.
I like to bring my family here for a taste of home. Shantha made our last experience very enjoyable we appreciated his patience and kindness.
Great food and fast service
"Beautifully decorated place. We were there for brunch. The dishes looked promising and although they were technically cooked to perfection, they just fell flat on flavor and even seasoning. One time visit."
Delicious and authentic. Great and kind service.
Was okay. Vegetarian option was not very palatable so had to gobble up the dessert
Good at Edison Pizza is excellent!  Eddie is an excellent server!  Highly recommend this restaurant!
"Neat, quick, and professional. Just stopped for a quick appetizer after shopping and heading to the hotel.  Looks like a good suit and tie place!"
"Great food, fast and friendly service. If your looking for real Mexican food, this is definitely the place to go."
"The menu offering was impressive, something for everybody but the piquancy was not there. I understand it's tough to get the South Indian flavor here but A2B was not up to the hype.  Nail in the coffin was the dreadful coffee that was served in a traditional South Indian cup but tasted like coffee flavored dehydrated milk powder."
"Matzoh ball soup, potato pancakes, pierogi are an amazing. The braised meat and cabbage/mushroom were my favorite!"
Good food but need better service
Always spot ion with taste and great ambiance
"I was upset Bc they charge me the amount that they want as service over the bill, this is something that you have to choice, the food is okay nothing especial, but it’s annoying that They put the tip that they want!!!"
We waited 2 hours for our food and we traveled all the way from Albany ny.  That's was totally unexceptable and some of the food we ordered and paid for was not in our bag. The food was tasty.
"Great bar, nice a dark no flashing lights. Great juke box.  Bartenders are the nicest. Prices are the lowest"
"It's like your MOM made everything! pancakes, spinach pie, chicken pot pie, soup etc. ALL EXCELLENT"
I enjoy this plae. Small but clean and food is Great.
Best Mexican restaurant in perth amboy!!!!! I've tried them all and the tacos here are amazing. Food is authentic and customer service is marvelous. Come check them out.
"This is good Location in Jamaica 169, There r lot of Grocey Store, Restaurant, So any Muslim people specially Bangladeshi people can take Halal Food & take out from these Restaurant."
"I tried the fish tacos and they were so good! You get three large tacos! Only street parking is available but for the price and portions, it's so worth the trouble."
"Even though the waitress was very nice, we didn’t enjoy the food. The food was tasteless."
"Music too loud, food ok, waitstaff good. Ok for a quick soup & salad."
"Opted for curbside dining, staff friendly but the food was disappointing."
"Could be the best burger in Manhattan, I was going to cut little bit of manager’s attitude but the taste overweighted his approach. Outside cabins are just for 2 people but the other side can serve more people with heath, ever it was 40F, we were able take off our coats and eat comfortably."
The food was good and the service was also. The kids really enjoyed it
The quesabirria and birria tacos were amazing would definitely recommend to people who are new to the restaurant!
Best Restaurant in this town we try charsii karahi and Goal Ghappa chiken Tikka and Naan all food And appetizers very tasty and service very Good
"My first time at Olive Garden and the fam was pleasantly surprised.  They were very busy but the waiter tried his best to be attentive.  Seems he was also trying his best to fake an Italian accent but it wasn't very good. :-)  For was very good.  Better than we thought it would be, expecially with them being so busy."
Sat for 20 minutes and no one served us. Wish we could have tried the food but had to walk out. Tables that came in after us got food and drink and we sat there like we didn’t exist.
Casual and friendly with solid food. Casual but comfortable outdoor seating.
Thoroughly enjoyed our dinner. Great and welcoming hostess and servers. Dinner was filling and very good. Can't wait to come back and try other options.
"If you have a problem with Pho One, it’s you who has a problem because this place is amazing. Me and my mother come here regularly and it’s the best pho I’ve ever had."
"Excellent food in a charming neighborhood restaurant. Casual, family-friendly. Service was friendly, attentive and very good. A bit pricey but the portions are substantial, sangria is excellent. A little bright, a little loud, but all contributes to the happy neighborhood vibe"
"Nice setting.  Great service, trendy Thai restaurant close to the theater district and hell's kitchen."
Always the best food
Well for meat lovers this place is just out of heaven
"Great place, great food, great customer service"
Really good food!!
Food was great and staff was attentive. My friend got the bento box and I got the bibimbap. I finished every drop!
Roast Lamb fried rice is amazing!!!
Ordered for the first time today. got chicken burrittos. i must say they were great. what a real burrito should be like. and you cant beat the price. delivery was quick.
If your restaurant closes at midnight why not post that the kitchen closes at 10pm. So that customers don't think that have time to have a quick dinner when. They arrive at 10:06pm to be told the kitchen is close.  Nothing on the website!   Thanks Echo for a wonderful dinner.
"Good music, good food, good drinks"
"The service attitude is very poor, the dishes are very unsatisfactory, it is not recommended to visit again."
"One of the worst place in China town.  Foods are just okay. Not bad not good.  But too pricy compared to others there.    So arrogant servers.    They were kind, but a server requested more tips.  I didnot. He threw away his pen onto his desk. Very rude.  They want me to tip on togo items too with 15%. What? ???  Customers can tip whatever they want.  A bad experience."
"We went for ""Date Night"". You cant beat, a bottle of wine, salad/soup/ appy, main course,a side to share and dessert for $99.00! Service was excellent and the meal was excellent."
"Five stars is not enough. We drive from NJ just to eat here. You can’t go wrong with anything you order. The food is authentic to the Basque region of Spain. Kudos to the chef. The staff is efficient and friendly. We are salivating thinking of the next time we go. By the way, we always go on weekends for lunch and order food to go for dinner. Just can’t get enough."
Sushi is pretty good. Just a note that rolls come in 6 and have seaweed on the outside.
Great pizza totally impressed !! Yum a must try.
My family lives in the neighborhood and we order from Amitabha on a weekly basis. The food is amazing and 100% vegan. They work some magic on tofu and seitan as a substitute for meat. Our favorite is the BBQ vege roast pork with Cedar fried rice.  The owners are very friendly and are always giving my parents advice on how to make healthy vegan meals at home.
Food is amazing... fresh and delicious. Lamb roast and sizling salta my favorite.
Our waiter was really great and the service impeccable. We enjoyed our food and the drinks were delicious (classic lemonade and mango/strawberry iced tea).
The food has a great taste but the ambiance was not that great the music was to loud and was not that great there were other clients the were really loud also and  the staff lady she was like tired or so not sure she treat us fine but i think she needs to get better
Tasty Turkish food. Highly recommended.
I ordered the Siracha noodles and they were incredible! The flavor was amazing and the amount of chicken added was great! Will definitely be coming back.
"I had a great experience. The owner came over to see if I was enjoying my food. The food was so delicious, I ordered some to take home."
"Probably the best and ""only"" indian in the immediate area.  Food is good and lunch prices are reasonable.  Parking is easiest in the back parking lot."
the food is good but inconsistent.  on some days it's super tasty and on other days it gets bland.
A wide selection for Korean & Asian food groceries. Price is reasonable. Its food court offers variety of Korean meals. The shopping environment is bright and clean.
Beautiful restaurant ambiance  Food was good - nothing mind blowing based on what we ordered (all vegetarian) but would def recommend and come again
Been a staple to the neighborhood in the good years and the bad and has always kept its door open and its food fresh thank you  for years of good food and great service AKA Victor
"I hadn't been to an olive garden in so many years and I am so happy at the pleasure of coming here for the first time in a long time. The service was amazing along with our waiter, Kevin and the manager, Sean. Everyone was on point from beginning to end. The food was amazing and fresh. My friends and I will definitely come back again."
Food was delicious!
Always Top Notch
Good food and great atmosphere. The food was good. Less veggies options other than salad.
Amazing from entering to sitting to eating. Moment we entered hospitality and my waiter Juan introducing himself and service ...DRINKS MADE WITH LOTS OF Food was perfected. Street Corn must have. RICE LIKE MAMMA. VIBE IS 1000% ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS GO AND TRY . IF YOU ARE DISAPPONTED COME BACK TO MY REVIEW AND ROAST ME...LOL
Delicious and affordable!
I went to celebrate my sister's birthday and what an incredible restaurant this is!  Also the music and vibe is perfect.
perfect I did come today with my Algerian friends and we liked the food so much thank you guys
Amazing experience! Service is an absolute delight. Food is fresh and so delicious. What a treat of a place.
I can only appreciate the delicious Donegal Salmon me being Northern Irish.I have yet to find better any where else.
Real taste of Pakistani n Indian foods. I loved the environment and warm welcomed.
Ask for their specials!
Love the food and service!
"Food and wine is GREAT.  BUT:  it took them 50 minutes (actually still waiting, could be more) for them to prepare my meal. And they are not even busy. Not coming back, they take too long and offer you  more and more wine so you end up paying more, do that with tourist not with locals."
"Having dinner at this restaurant is an unforgettable experience from the moment you step through the doors. The decor is mesmerizing with extravagant details, 20+ft. high ceilings and an incomparable ambiance.  The staff were friendly, knowledgeable and professional. The music was soooooo good and the food was beyond delicious. This restaurant is a must-see and the food is worth every penny."
Excellent take out restaurant. They do have a small seating area but I'd recommend a take out. Call ahead and your food will be ready when you get there. The portions and the flavors were big and the prices low. Their summer special Lime Soda kept us coming back. Highly recommend this place.  …
Love this place!
"The food, decor, ambience, wait staff,  neighborhood was all Amazing! I"
the food is fabulous and the family who owns it are  wonderful people always making sure each guest is treated like family.
Very rich empanada..
Loved  the food. But I still had to wait a while even though I had a reservation. But to be fair we were missing a person from out party.
"One of our favorite spots in the area, they always have everything we're looking for & the store is very organized. & we can never leave without stopping in the bakery first, soo good! Also very impressed to see the precautions they have set up up to combat the virus."
"Freaking love the food here, everything on their menu taste freaking delicious and the service staff are the best. The prices are very affordable and its a great place for the family as well."
My wife took me here as a birthday gift. We caught the show murdered by the mob. A murder mystery dinner. Pretty cool experience food was good.
Plentiful and delicious lunch buffet. Food is incredibly flavorful. Best Indian food in Bergen County.
"Great consistent food, beautiful atmosphere.  They do need to retrain the waiters.  Last night we were told he had a partner however we never saw him.  Didn't get bread till halfway through the meal.  Asked 4 times for water and finally ordered a bottle.   Waiter started off attentive but then we was no where to be found.   I love this place but this will bring them down"
The food is very taste and i would like to suggest the people to have food here..
Excellent restaurant   Loved the service and food was amazing 
I don't need to make my own poke now.
Great rustic feel once you enter the establishment. Staff was really friendly and accommodating.  Food is delicious and proportionate. Stuffed burger and mango habanero wings are delicious.  Check Groupon for deals.
Nice food.. great service
"Our server was very attentive but almost halfway through my food found a long human hair in my plate of pasta. Workers should wear caps inside the kitchen. The hair was well mixed in the food, there was no way it fell there on the way to our table."
It was great and the and the food was delicious definitely a must go
"Food is pretty good, service is slow and inattentive and hookahs are below average. Go to Kamils, Mazaj or LaZiza. Even getting the check here takes 10+ min."
This was a very nice Family Restaurant. You feel at home as soon as you walk in. And the owners treat you so well. Great Cuban food and latte!
Always great food...pricier now but at least portions have been same.
"Amazing food, Amazing Drinks, Amazing Vibes! Great Prices! They need to expand down to florida! This food is amazing.. wait did i say that already? Make sure you get the Nut Cracker & if you're feeling a little nice... then just make it a super nut cracker... Thank me later."
"I had a great Sazarac to start. The pre fix lunch was a deal. The duck was tender and flavorful, complemented with the flavor of fruit. The chocolate cake was different than expected, more of a pudding texture than a cake. I would try a different desert next time."
Excellent dirty martinis (with Hendricks). Would recommend!
Served by barbers. Best uniform ever seen. Take a photo with over 60 years cash register. I did.
Great food and the girls are nice. Sucks that they don't deliver
Excellent proportions of food. Good price. Nice location. Good service. Must try their fabulous home fries.
Cant believe I broke my diet for that steak burrito… people were nice. my order was wrong. the steak was dry and terrible cut of meat for this purpose. Will not try my luck again.
I got the duck comfy and loved it! Decent portions too. The restaurant decor was awesome (I especially liked the giant bank vault door) and service was great. The mixed drinks are on point too!
"Excellent service, delicious foods and so clean and frendly atmoosfery"
"This restaurant may have change the owner recently, now it's very bad in food taste and cleaness, plus the prices are very high. Don't recommand to take out ot eat there."
"Friendly staff, food order came as requested and in a timely manner, place was busy, but very well managed."
Our waitress Jessica is and was amazing as usual. The food was incredible especially my favorite tuna cones. Tried the tofu ramen bowl for the first time and it was amazing!! Doesn't taste like tofu!! Can't wait for our next experience and new dishes
"I held a large group event here and everything was excellent. The service was great, the food was top notch, and the venue worked great for our group of 40. Highly recommend for anyone looking to host an event in mid-town."
"The Qianlong cabbage is a bit too sweet, but the rest are delicious, especially the fish dishes. The fish is very tender and well seasoned. Boiled and sweet and sour are both delicious."
Great service and staff! Made it in time for the lunch special and it was great. The smaller sizes were perfect and it's a shame it's not available on the regular menu for those with weight management concerns. Great waitress and hostess- we tried a new wine (remember to ask for your wine sample) and ended up buying the bottle. It was cheaper for the 3 of us. Well definitely be back!
Their food & drinks is soooooo good 1 of my favorite restaurants. And the prices are amazing
"Great taste, good service, great atmosphere. Portions are smaller than expected, at least for the special rolls."
"Love this place! Pleasant service, great cocktails & the tapas are fresh & tasty."
"The shrimp tacos had about 4 shrimp rum goo however price went up cups got small, no white meat The atmosphere outside nice they also took temperature good job. Made me some shrimp at home the best ever."
"This was my first time back at Gotham after they reopened. I was only at the bar, though of course the drinks and the food were delicious. The renovations look great and the staff are all top-notch."
Food was ok-to-good.  We ordered tacos which were small.  Everything could've used a bit more flavor.
Nice food  Good customer service  Surain thank you for your good service. …
Having very fun with girls night with freshness;)
Very solid pho in this area. Recommend
The food is horrible can’t lie even the wings were bad very salty and tasted like an old batch reheated
"Great Ambience, nice And quiet place. No loud music. Perfect for date night."
"REALLY REALLY BAD SERVICE! I WAS WAITING WITH MY FAMILY 1 and 1/2 HOUR FOR A TABLE.  THE GIRL AT THE DOOR WAS VERY BUSY ON HER PHONE TO LOOK FOR ONE AND THE WORST IS THAT THE RESTAURANT WAS ALMOST EMPTY.  MY CHILDREN, MY MOTHER-IN-LAW, MY HUSBAND AND I LEFT WITH HUNGER THANKS TO THIS GIRL."
"Wonderful experience all around. Food and service excellent! Love what they’ve done with the place too, beautiful new interior."
"Reasonably priced Thai food. They have a good variety of items and do the classics very well. It's americanized Thai, so expect dishes to be more sweet, less spicy. Portions are super generous and prices are fair. Staff is friendly and the ambiance is festive."
Amazing place.Great service. Food is delicious.
"Diner looking place, the only thing that gives you an impression of Thailand is the random table in the middle of the restaurant where waitresses keep plates and utensils. After coming back from Thailand nothing in NJ comes close to the authentic Thai food. Pad Thai here which is marked ""best seller in NJ"" was sub par compare to Pho Thai-Lao Kitchen in Maywood, NJ (still the best pad thai for my taste buds)."
"Our server was not attentive at all. We had a party of 10, no extra napkins, only the ones the utensils are wrapped in. Never came back to ask if we wanted extra bread, soup or salad nor to refill our drinks. When one one person in our group asked for another soup it took forever to bring, to the point we all finished our dinner and the soup had not arrived. Never got the chocolates you normally get with your bill, which is no big deal, but the kids look forward to those."
"Good food, clean and extremely entertaining! Don't forget to take your saki... at a distance lol"
"Excellent Thai food. Very good, at all vegetables, fruit and chicken, beef or pork. …"
Magnificent sushi and service
Best Pizza. Love their lunch specials and choices
You have to visit
"What a beautiful restaurant! Festive and clean, courteous and attentive service, and what food....a huge selection, new and special flavors, generous portions, simply a pleasure!! Recommended everywhere!  Not cheap but very enjoyable."
"Oxfails and streamed veg were awesome  Rice was bland. Neded salt or something.  Service was mediocre.  Will return though, nice Bronx spot."
Most delicious pasta ever had !
They aren’t open 24/7 like their website says! It’s a scam and they are only open 12-6. So be prepared to be disappointed.
"Discover a hidden gem that offers more than just a bar experience. Indulge in great food that goes beyond your typical bar fare. Located in Franklin Square, this spot is the perfect choice for those looking for a late-night dining option. Don't expect ordinary bar food here; instead, enjoy restaurant-quality dishes that will leave your taste buds satisfied. Trust me, this spot offers some of the best restaurant-quality food in town."
"Disappointed. Placed an order early in the morning to be delivered at around 4:30 today.  They just contacted us to cancel.  It is 4:20 PM.  Terrible, simply terrible way to do buisness."
"Beautiful place to drink with friends...a warm family atmosphere, very clean and nicely decorated."
Good and varied food!
This place is amazing so if you're ever in New York you must go
Great food just terrible wait with service whether it's take out or eating in
The ambiance of this restaurant cannot be beat! I absolutely loved my meal and cocktail here. The ceiling fixtures are exquisite. Service was fantastic.
"Located in Hell's kitchen, New York.  Interesting Eastern decor and vibe.  Covid vaccination proof required for indoor seating. Outdoor seating available too.  Excellent food and drinks, including cocktails and wine.  Service is excellent; food is served in less than 10 minutes of ordering.  Default is somewhat spicy, so order based on your tolerance for spicy food.  Reasonably priced for the area."
"Errrr, it was breakfast and you can't really ruin it. Waiter was ok"
"Amazing food, great hookah, chill vibes. Our server Kardelen was very attentive and quick. Our new go to spot."
Madonna mama Mia!!!!  I Just ate the best  cheesesteak hero..I mean  I have had cheesesteak in NY and NJ Do yourself a favor and order one..I promise you..you won't be disappointed 
"100% recommended, good food and excellent service! A super hygienic place"
Good food!
"Amazing Punjabi style restaurant, the lady at the counter and the chef was kind enough to accept our order even after the restaurant kitchen was closed."
Food is always great here. The NSFW and baked goods are awesome.
Great service and food is delicious!
I went there for a after funeral  Lunchen .  The food is  the service is out of this world.  If you ever get to go there you will enjoy it tremendously.
Nice place to meet friends.
"My first time here. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. We ordered the Chicken Shish, Sarma Beyti, Babagannoush, Hummus, and Milk Pudding. Everything was fresh and cooked perfectly. Great atmosphere to top it off. The bread is excellent. Definitely will be coming back. Thank you!"
Good food! I like it! My third visit! Resently moved in the neighborhood! Looking for a good place to date! But it would be nice if the tables had the old fashioned white cloth on them!
Classic. Think supper club from your parent’s day. Drinks were quite nice. The food was delicious. Service (Jeff) was efficient and informative. Recommended.
"Dirty  place!!!  I been coming to this place for over 20 years and remember the employees being very clean when handling your food. Nowadays they go from handling your food to handle cash from other customers and back to handle your food, wont wear any gloves, whash her hands. Coney island you know better than that!!"
Little bit busy at today but we wait for order only 10 min and it's was not bed i don't like some service i have to remind order again and again them what i ordered and i didn't receive yet finely it's was all Great..
"Amazing, delicious food. Good atention!"
Amazing meal! Bring your own booze.
"Very amazing experience. The food is like no other and it brings me so much joy to see a country with a culture as beautiful as Afghanistan have representation of its cuisine here in New Jersey. I would recommend this place to anyone, every dish was absolute perfection."
"The food has gone down the hill. 10+ years ago when the original founders the food was fantastic, I was a regular twice a week for the deviled fish and Kothu. As owners changed, the food is a disaster. Unfortunately, it's the only Sri Lankan restaurant in NJ now. I wish they bring the authenticity of the Sri Lankan food back. Please improve your food. The service is okay. It would be nice if they can keep the place a little cleaner."
Excellent food!
"Delicious and authentic cuisine.  Service was pretty quick and attentive, if not always with a smile.  Got me seated very quickly during a lunch rush and the bread came out hot, perfect, and right away.  Definitely recommended."
Lamb chops lollipops  …
"Delicious food, huge portions, and the service was excellent! Outside seating was very nice but I'd recommend some mosquito lamps or something.  …"
"My past few visits I've noticed the new menu prices have increased significantly and the amount if food on my plate has decreased. The food quality is still there, but other restaurants in the area are much better values and l still feel hungry when I leave Mariachi."
Momos are delicious   The chive ones are especially good!! …
"Great, great food and service was good.  Big different from before when the service was slow."
"This italian restaurant is my favorite!!!! The staff are welcoming, and the food is always delicious. I visit frequently."
The service was good,  but the pre-fixed Mother's day menu was not mentioned on the website. Nor were they equipped to handle the heavey volume of patrons on Mother's day.  To top it of they ran out of wings. I don't think I'll be back to this spot again."
Delicious Northern Italian food!!  Great host Nancy Martino for planning our reunion party. Will be back.
Awesome place.  I live a little far from here but take the drive with a lot of smiles.
Very good food
It’s not bad
Good selections of multicultural items.  Sale item are generally good buys.  Fresh seafood and produce. Most of their meats are frozen for ease of slicing.
I BEEN WAITING FOR ALMOST 2 HOURS FOR MY FOOD And they shrimp and broccoli is dry …
"Bad experience, would skip. Food took 45 minutes to get to us after asking the waiter multiple times. We ordered the bread with cheese, fried artichoke, and chicken.  Bread with cheese was tiny (and took 45 minutes even though it’s zero prep)  Fried artichoke was oily.  Chicken itself was good, but the sides were cold."
We received very poor service from the wait staff. Appetizers were good but the entrees were just okay. The veal parmesan was overcooked. Dessert was fabulous.
Great tasty Turkish food!
"had lamb haneeth, the signature item at this restaurant.  was okay first few bites, then I got bored with its simple flavor. rice was too different and gave up eating.  simply didn't fit my taste."
"This is the best restaurant in Yonkers. The food is deliciously  amazing, friendly people, service is great. No wait time at all.    They also served party. The meal is delicious, for individual order so for parties! We definitely coming back !!!"
Happen to walk by and noticed how busy it was in Tony's Pizza in Bushwick and decided to give it a try. Waited a while for our order but the managers were very nice to my wife and I with updates on our order. After getting our order with extra perks because of our extended wait time we were very pleased with our order especially the quinoa and mushroom slice which my wife really enjoyed. Thanks guys.Keep up the great food and hospitality.We will be back.
"It was fresh, light and so worth it. I’m very particular about Japanese cuisine. However, this was decent!!!"
The good was delicious. However. The service leaves a lot to be desired. We had a party of 20. The waiters did not know what each individual ordered. I ordered a medium rare churrasco and they serve it well done instead. The barmaid charged someone drinks on somebody credit card even though the lady paid her cash. Needs more organized servers. I don't thing any of the waiters could work in a restaurant downtown. They would not last a day    But the food was rather good.
Had the jajangmyon and it was great. Service is really nice and outdoor dining is fully available with a shade.
The food was delicious and the workers were professional.  Definitely going back there again
That was so good! We had a few dim sums and a whole duck (take the pancakes!). Everything tasted fresh and amazing.  The house-made XO sauce was the best I ever had
"5* great food, good service with everything including meats, vegetables, fruits dessert and ice cream."
THIS IS A COZY LIL PLACE WHICH MY HONEY AND I EAT OFTEN . GREAT FOOD PARKING A LIL KRAZY BUT FOR THE MOST WE ALWAYS GET PARKING . GREAT SERVICE VERY FRIENDLY EVEN THE OWNER IS A SWEETIE AND CHECKS ON HER CUSTOMERS WHIC IS ALWAYS VERY NICE
Awesome place.. great food and service!!
Good portuguese food
"really nice pho! significant portion size, good noodles and broth. i really like getting takeout here.    HOWEVER: the hours are not great! it's closed on sundays and closes at 8pm so often :( way too early!!!"
"Delicious food, good price and great service"
"I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant. The decor, service, ambiance, all exceptional. And the food was amazing. So much options you’d need to make multiple visits to try everything you’d like."
The food was good but the price so high not make since
Very bad service. Two girls  working. I want to give them credit. It should be more girls working on a Sunday afternoon. They took more than 5 minutes to notice us (two people) and bring us the menu
"Have to try the meatballs!! Don't be scared away if the place is quiet; food is good, authentic. Staff is attentive without being overbearing."
nice menu a bit expensive
Excellent delectable and clean food and dessert  Especially  Rice  pudding for  dessert
"Exquiste!!! I can honestly say one of the best French cuisines I had the honor of trying. The hospitality, food, wines, and ambiance was impeccable with a sophisticated approach in technique and artistry of plating and creating the extraordinary flavors."
My absolute favorite place to eat! Food is always delicious and the staff is amazing
"I don’t recommend this place because of the service they offer to their customers. My friends and I placed our order, as I was eating I found 2 long hair in my food. I mentioned it to the staff and manager, all they said was sorry. I didn’t get a meal replacement and was charged for it. I would never go back to this place again!!!!"
Always a fun spot to dine with a nice view of the Manhattan.  Besides dining in the restaurant area for food there is a great lounge area towards the front that you can just have drinks with your friends.  The staff very pleasant and accommodating!  Good spot to come with your group of friends or even  on a date.
Tom kha soup is incredible. We also enjoyed the panang curry and the vibe. Come between 5 and 7 for happy hour. It’s a party!
"Their food was delicious, the dining experience is a bit different as well"
"Very nice staff, great food, awesome views!"
"This is a lovely, small, friendly spot with fun menu items, beautifully presented. Service is great."
Great food with great service and atmosphere.
"I celebrated my 25th birthday at Steakhouse 85 and had a marvelous experience! The Dry Aged Delmonico Steak and truffle tater tots were absolutely on par! I was surprised with vanilla sundae with a candle for my birthday. I highly recommend Steakhouse 85 for special events like a birthday, date night or graduation."
Optimal. Top-notch Italian cuisine. Comfortable atmosphere and friendly staff. Worth the cost a little higher than the average.
"Was a tough night for them.  Not enough service coverage, slow kitchen, and one of our 4 meals was poorly cooked and inedible.  The manager made good, but unfortunate situation.  Our server was good, apologetic and explained what happened.  Overall we like OG and will give them another chance."
"Service was excellent, food delicious"
"My experience there was horrible . The wait was ridiculous though I had reservations for two. My reservation was for 6:45 to be seated inside, instead we ended up outside. The server was rude and acted as if though he didn't want to serve my table.  They were more willing to serve the marathon runners than the regular patrons. The service was just the worst for all the money charged for two simple dishes. A bowl of rigatoni pasta with sausage that was non existent and a salmon oreganata. I was also forced to order extra sausage for the pasta dish. The sausage was brought to the table uncut just plopped down on the table as if though we were bothering the server. A lemonade was the only other item that we had at the table. The dinner I waited for came to a cool $150.00 . I left a tip of $40 though in my mind nothing should have been left. I'm bigger than that and decided to behave as such. I Definitely did not enjoy my meal and remain annoyed by the poor service. A reservation for 6:45 pm and not seated until 7:30 pm and that was due to me having to assert myself so that they would seat my guest and I. They overbooked and instead of telling patrons that they had parties of anything less than four wait while they continuously seated parties of 5- 10 people. A really bad taste left in my mouth the server the hostess need to definitely be replaced. Dinner outing was the nightmare from hell."
Ate at the bar great cocktails and excellent food.  Loved the meatballs.
"Terrible experience. Obnoxious, unprofessional manager ruined my parents visit. Tried to make a reservation and was told it won’t be necessary. Asked for an umbrella for our table in 90 degree heat. Manager belittled my whole family and mocked our request. Hard to believe but true. This place is known for terrible food and service. Won’t go back."
Cozy place and excellent food
"Delicious. Can't go wrong here, menu is great."
Waitresses were all super awesome.  The pizza was amazing.  The sign in the window about your choice to wear a mask was perfect.
The worst most expensive Peruvian food and it wasn't even good I bought a lomo saltado never in my life have I had lomo satado that it was spicy... It was so spicy that my lips swelled and burned so much
"Best Caprinahs around. Great food. Service is dicey when it's busy. There IS a bartender who could use a lesson in being MORE FRIENDLY considering she's a bartender. Overall, it's a great place I enjoy visiting."
Great food and great place to go alone or with people
Sweet food  …
Best Peruvian food in the city. Even though it's expensive the ingredients are fresh and the service is great. Their ceviche is better than the ones you get in Peru. The drinks are great. Lomo Saltado and aji de gallina are a must try dishes
The true flavor on sea food. Alex and the team knows how to bring good flavor to your palate. Love this place #1 on my restaurant list.
Very good food and service it was just kind of noisy
A beautiful and fun place to see a Jewish atmosphere in New York was really fun.  Great service.
The food here is absolutely amazing and the service matches. The staff are very friendly and attentive. The food is always cooked to perfection every time! The place is clean and the drinks are great! I highly recommend this restaurant!
"Very bad attitude, They don't have respect for customer, so I cancel my party."
Very bad service. Was not told some items would take much longer. They likely forgot to add it
Excellent Vegan food from Amitabha Vegan!
"I had a very coucou dinner which allowed me to taste a little bit of almost everything. The dishes were delish. The ambiance was calm and romantic. The staff were lovely, and so kind. Looking forward to future visits."
Bad service!! Will definitely not go back. I placed an order over the phone and they sold my order to someone else supposely because I was late..
I love it
"Very rich seasoning, their lunches cost $12. Ecuadorian food."
Been coming here for the past 20years … it only gets better and better each visit. Outstanding service and quality in both the restaurant and market.
I came in for takeout. My food came quickly and it tasted delicious
"Lamb Adana Kabob with Afghani rice, served with salad and bread. Tastes perfect, and if you like to make it spicy there are plenty of condiments on the table to bring it to your palate. Attentive servers with friendly attitude although the place can get very busy real quickly."
Me and my granddaughter had a lovely lunch at the Olive Garden. The food was very delicious the waitress was very nice and respectable and we just enjoyed ourselves. The only thing you didn't have enough of season for me but the food was very good and enough for the next day dinner that was the Olive Garden at Gateway Mall Brooklyn New York.
"I was here about a month ago. I meant to write a review earlier, but forgot. I'm not getting any younger. I picked up a grandma's pie and probably ate four slices just on the drive home. It was incredibly good! One of the top pizzas I've had in NJ. They were very friendly too! Great experience and highly recommended!"
"food is no longer Portuguese  no taste what so ever, after 25 years I am looking for another authentic Portuguese restaurant, prices up quality down"
"Have never had such a wonderful -home like taste sandwiches in NY since i moved here 14 years ago! Amazing falafal & shawrma sandwiches, beautiful atmosphere, clean facility, reasonable prices, and most of all pleasant & humble owner & staff!"
The food was good and the price was excellent.
"They were missing a couple of main ticket items we came here for (""ran out""). Food was good and cheap but portions were very skimpy. Would rather pay more and receive more instead of having to order double.    Keep in mind that they auto charge gratuity for anything over 4 people. 22% gratuity is a bit outrageous considering we barely saw the waiters. Overall ok, but not what you see on instagram."
A great lunch for take out. I'm not sure if it's me but everytime I go back there's something a little different about the same order. It's nothing bad but just something different.    I usually get rice with eel pork and chicken ($18) which is enough to feed 2 people. Comes with a soup too.
I'm a regular here. It's family owned has great food.
The food was very bland.  The stuffed artichoke was so bland the breading on top was to mushy no flavor at all missing salt.    The lasagna seemed good until I bit it and it was cold. The sauce on top was hot which means the lasagna was made separately from the sauce weird.    Very bland food. Bread in the beginning was good. Service was good but definitely not the best Italian food.    I read the reviews after I ordered and realized some people have also complained about cold and bland food.
"Food was amazing! Picture of the lake in google was misleading, in fact it’s a corner restaurant. A bit pricey, but very worth it. Apart of the creepy waiter, the experience was amazing!"
Very good lunch with a friend. We ordered off of the lunch specials. Great value. Goosd service. Ladies room could be cleaner.
A delicious meal
"Never disappoints. Old fashion, family run restaurant. Great food and service. Prices are extremely reasonable. Cash only. Full bar."
Amazing tasting food! Excellent service!  Worth a trip from anywhere!
"The staff is so nice, very courteous and helpful. The food is amazing. The best kebabs and the curries are great too.  It takes a little time for obvious reasons they make them when you order. Fresh, hot and delicious. The service is great. It’s a small place, probably mostly take out, but there is space inside to sit and eat.  It’s a BYOB"
"I never taste there food but the service wasnt pleasant at all. First of all you have items on the menu that sounds selicious but once u order they say oh we don't ha e oxtails or bbq ribs. They shouldn't call their business. A.e the weekend , they should call it aint no more. Oh before I exit their prices is super high."
Always good food... great service... cool vibes and great scenery!!  You WONT be disappointed! …
"Great food, very decent service and prices."
Excellent food. I like the soup and spring rolls
We stopped in because of how beautiful the decor was and were happy our food and drinks were just as amazing!! I'm still thinking about the rose thai tea and massaman curry!
"Food and service was phenomenal. Our server was Byron he was very attentive with us, great service.  Highly recommend!"
Amazing experience. Great people. Good vibe 
I love their banchan ( korean side dishes) . Although a bit pricey but worth it. Their fruits are fresh . Overall I love this store!
Best chicken wings n town
"Here capitalism comes before customer welfare. My friend was bumped into 5 times because the space was too narrow for the staff to walk through. Squeeze in fewer tables? Service took a long time. food was super good. After complaining that there was no chicken at all, it was served generously."
"On a chilly night, the heat was not working properly though they did get it working. These things happen. I would prefer to listen to music of the region ... it's an Italian restaurant or at least an Italian singer but it was soft and easy for me to listen to anyway. I had escarole and bean soup then salmon arturo which is baked salmon and I ordered it with angel hair pasta. All tasty. I concluded with lemon sorbet and a caffe latte. Terrific waiter...Elmer. Request him!"
Tremendous Kitchen.
"We come here all the time & have really enjoyed seeing it evolve from basically a takeout counter (still available, of course) to the current incarnation, a charming group of eat-in tables alongside the open kitchen. Just keeps getting better."
I could eat this everyday. Love the food here and the service is always great. And everything on their menu is reasonably priced too.
"Thai. Fried. Rice. WOW.    The fried rice here is authentic, has spice, and for vegetarian food, this place is . Piece of advice, please get the tofu fried rice, you won't regret it :) …"
Food and service are mediocre and valet tries to muscle you into tipping
"Had Sunday brunch here just prior to departing NYC. Great vibe, good food  had the chicken waffles which was recommended by the bar girl who was also very good. I’ll make a point of coming here again. …"
"Best dim sum place found in NJ so far! Even better than Chengdu No.1 Palace, which I used to go a lot.  Come before 11 am or after 2 pm on weekends, otherwise get ready to wait for a long time!  My favorite dim sums here is the porridge, the chicken feet, two different kinds of shumai, the pork ribs, and the coconut cake!"
Anyone looking for authentic Indian flavor in New Jersey - this is the place to be! Great ambience and hospitality by both the owner - Mr. Deepak and the staff members. Would definitely recommend their butter chicken roll!
"Good food, nice atmosphere and friendly waiters.  Pretty good Sangria too."
Great food and reasonably priced.
The worst dining experience i have ever had. I made reservation 2 weeks in advance we got Seated right away. 2 hours Wait for the food to arrive and half of order was incorrect. TOTALLY UNACCPECTABLE.
Best place so far in New Jersey and New York I have been to a lot of places but this is really the top 3 in my list very organized nice and clean must try this place
Very good quality Chinese food.
"MR MARIO IS AMAZING! We ordered over 100 lunches for our school, and let me say ... everything was excellent! The orders were perfect, the food was delicious and the portion size was  more than enough! The students loved everything! We will be ordering here every week!  Definitely check this place out u won’t be disappointed!"
Here are some pros and cons of my experience:    Pros: The food was good. The service was good.    Cons: There were bugs right next to you in the bathrooms. The smell there was terrible. There were drunk people right next to you. The floor was the slippery that a kid was walking and fell and almost broke his head open.
I like the place.. the ambiance and the staff always greeting u once u enter the place
Great Visit!!!  Started with some meatballs finished with a pizza!  Everything was great and the service was outstanding  #PizzaHulkApproved
They should start training how to provided worse customer service with worse possible tested food. So other people know what they shouldn't do. One stare is more what they deserve.
Good food. Reasonably priced.
"The decor isn't great, but the food makes up for it.  They have the traditional Chinese food fair as well as some more interesting items.  They make a Thai grilled chicken that is very flavorful.   There are only a few parking spots in the front, so be sure to look in the back."
"Chicken feet, black bean pork ribs, and shrimp siu mai are delicious  crispy fried rice rolls  Bean Curd Alcohol  Shrimp and Beef Cheong Fun Pu Pu  Jasmine tea is not good"
"Great place for North Indian food. The flavors are great and the service is friendly. Right now, they are waiting for their new furniture. Once it's in, this will be a great place for North Indian, Delhi food "
Slice was perfectly crispy great sauce and cheese!
"We had a party of 16 for my brother's birthday, and we were accommodated after being screwed over by Bahama Breeze. The staff worked hard so that they could accommodate us on a Saturday night. Everyone was so nice. The food was so good!! Olive Garden has definitely improved! We had the berry sangria that was so good! The food was excellent! The wait staff was so efficient and personable!"
"My boyfriend and I are regulars here - we love the pork soup dumplings and egg custard bun the most (we get them literally everytime). We also really enjoy any of the chicken dishes like the tangerine chicken and the General Tso's chicken. The hot tea is also a must for us - makes us feel nice and comfy right when we get in. The service is also always pretty quick, even when they have a packed place, and the hostess is super cheerful and remembers our faces, which we definitely appreciate."
"I tried many other pho-restaurants, but this is my favorite one. They have really tasty fried spring rolls."
Very good take out mom & pops service. Their food is all star Caribbean food every day.
Great selection of well prepared food.  Lots of variety and the portions and prices are great!
Cozy location. Amazing food. Great service.
"I’d love to visit the place again. You can go with your friends, family, partner or whosoever you wish to. You will be happy.. I really enjoyed food and hospitality.. Thank you guys.."
The food was AMAZING definitely coming back with the family
Best and only Spanish spot in town
"I have visited tons of Thai restaurants.  But by far, this is my favorite.  Their green curry is to die for."
"The food is really good here but beware when you are ordering take out or pick up, they will short you and be careful to check the order when picking up"
"Best paella hands down. Portions are huge. Been there several times. Customer service is great. However if you have a larger party, they tend to forget about you."
Always great food we take all our guests from other states here for a wonderful experience.
Good crowd higher priced
"The service is truly excellent. I love the ambiance! However, the food we chose this evening was less than exciting! Don’t order the cook pot, lobster salad, or the house salad! The pate and chestnut soup were lovely! Wine list is exceptional."
"Food is good quality, arrives fast, and promptly.  Their shrimp egg rolls are my favorite.  They also have a great ""healthy"" option menu with very satisfying dishes."
I cane here a year ago and the food was so good. Flavorful and just delicious!.. i often brag on how great the food  was. This last time I visited ny  and went..  the ghlaba wasn't very bland aswell as the mark. It didn't taste well seasoned at all. I bought a group with me and they have agree.
"Love this place! Great ambience, kind and attentive staff and amazing food!"
Great taste and service.
"Good food, fast service,  even with them maintaining the amount of people that were able to be inside.  They were always cleaning and  counting to make sure they were able to provide great timely service"
"The food was good, although my husband wasn't too fond of his chicken fried rice.  The lychee martinee wasn't as great as I expected. It had a stronger taste of a sweet syrup.  The coriander soup was very nice.  Service was good although I had to ask for the drinks menu, it wasn't provided or offered to us."
Beautiful atmosphere the food was ok.
Closed on Monday because of staff shortage. Please update your website to reflect this discision for those of us who drive 45 minutes to try you business out.
The best Peruvian food that I had test in the United State. The food is fresh (always) deliciously GOOD and well presented. Very great place.
"It was good, I enjoyed the atmosphere and decor very Asian. The food was great! Only thing is not more food choices as say(chicken & broccoli, chow main). Also you have to get dessert it's so so good! It's not cheap here but you will enjoy yourself!!"
Le Coucou is a beautiful restaurant. The food and service is great. This is a perfect place for dates/special occasions.
Trying to be high class but falls short. Music is obnoxious and location behind a gas station isn't ideal. Food was mediocre
Delicious food! Great service. Took pics of some of the apps
"I had a wonderful time here for his birthday dinner. Another couple joined us, along with their toddler, which was a struggle, but the staff accommodated us very well because I informed them prior to our arrival that we might have a stroller and they reserved a large table for us so that we'd have plenty of space and be out of the way."
We loved their food and their ambiance. Its a great place to eat. A little spicy for me but was delicious. Thanks babe for introducing me to different people and places to eat and enjoy ourselves.  Love you always    …
"Food was good, service as well"
"Food was amazing. The stuffed rigatoni with pesto special was incredible and my chicken Francese was one of the best I've ever had.    Great, friendly service with outdoor seating and pleasant atmosphere... Bronx staple and well-deserving of its reputation!"
"Food is very good. Drinks too. Best to order the value special. Sushi chef is KING! Who would have thought that a ""grill"" restaurant would have the best sushi I've had for months! 4 stars due to service. New wait staff is clumsy, inexperienced, and confused.  The guys need more training. The hostess isn't customer focused, even in a lull. New patio is lovely, although fire element wasn't working. Will return for the sushi."
