Our family went to try this restaurant on a late Sunday afternoon on a relatively nice day . I called beforehand to ensure they had outdoor seating available on that day and time . We had been looking forward to trying the restaurant as they have advertised about their outdoor tent area . When we arrived the $T$ said he wouldn ' t seat us outside because they did not want to go in and out to serve people . What ! ! ! ? ! ? ? ? ? ? ! We drove over 30 minutes to get there and had to turn around and head home .

The $T$ was horrible . Took us an hour to get seated and an additional 20 mins to get served drinks not food . I had my 2 toddlers with me but luckily as a mom i had snacks and drinks for them while we waited and ended up taking their meal home . Smh never again ! I would have appreciated it if they were honest n told us the appropriate waiting time than continually saying 10 minutes more .

Horrible customer $T$ an employee by the name of Kevin ( if that ’ s even his real name ) was rude and dismissive over the phone when I called to ask about happy hour .

I ’ ve never been to this restaurant and I always wanted to try it out but I ’ m definitely not going at all . Also when I asked to speak with the manager he says in regards to ? Questioning me as if he owns the place . I work as a restaurant manager myself and your employees make or break your business ! ! Don ’ t have people running your establishment that don ’ t want to do their job ! ! ! ! ! ! I ’ m very upset with the service I received and I will be writing a review on yelp as well .

The place does not have a good $T$ . They hired a bunch of kids that don ' t even know how to wait on tables . We sat there for over 15 minutes waiting to be asked if we wanted something to drink . Then at no time did they even return back toask us if we needed anything else . They did the same thing to the table right next to us . We had to ask someone to come by just to get water refills ! Ridiculous ! ! !

" I ' m a big fan of olive garden and Italian kitchen overall . This used to be a good olive garden location but not anymore . The $T$ were not friendly at all , the place smelled bad , the food was not good . What mostly bothered me is that servers were not wearing anything to cover their hair while carrying food . There were literally girls carrying a tray of food and their hair was falling inside the tray ! That was disgusting . Thankfully our food was brought by someone else . Overall not a good experience .

" This place  is busy and also on Eater ’ s list as one of the top places to go to in Chinatown . After the food tonight , I won ’ t be going back . We had the eggplant , stewed pork , soup dumplings , and whole fish with pine nuts . The soup dumplings have a thick skin and burst easily when picked up . It doesn ’ t have the bounciness you want . The ones with crab were also lacking in the fresh sweetness that crab meat usually brings to the soup dumplings . The eggplant tasted inauthentic and overtly sweet and minimal minced meat . No real highlight dish for us . Definitely more tailored towards an Americanized Chinese palate than authentic Shanghai tastes .    The $T$ was pretty quick and efficient . There are better Shanghainese options . "

The $T$ is good . Price is too high . The tip should be at the discretion of the customer not their decision . There shouldn ' t be an extra 10 % charge for paying with a credit card . The drinks are great but not worth paying extra money just to go have it .

$T$ is OK . I was thrilled to learn it was vegetarian / vegan . Drove 30 minutes to try this place . Person in the front was nice and polite . Food was a bit spicy despite me choosing not spicy . The biggest disappointment was the sticky rice . I just got a small glob for $ 3 . 50 . Maybe the presentation threw me off but i didn ’ t expect it to be a literal small scoop of rice  . Overall we would definitely go back and next time we will dine in and see how that experience is .

" Wow , I was amazed ! This is a definite 4 . 5 to me . All I care about is food quality and this is one of the only times I have liked chicken tikka . The balance of spice , heat , and flavor was right on point . The naan was soft hot and pillowy . Finally , the $T$ was great - - I have more than enough for two meals at $ 13 for lunch . Just make sure to ask for something made today . Cheers ! "

" Looks are deceiving . $T$ looks decent but the food looks like you can make it at home in a microwave . Horrible service . Almost killed my friend with an onion allergy he asked multiple times if there were onions . They said there were no onions in anything he ordered , everything he ordered came with onions . "

" $T$ was pretty good . The Morel burger was a little overdone ; I asked for medium and it was closer to well done . Cheese topping on burger wasn ' t melted but it was a tasty burger , nevertheless . Fries were good too . Had the crab cake as an appetizer and it was delicious . My wife had the vegetarian Cajun dish and said it was good too . A little on the pricey side , but presentation and quality were good , so worth the visit . "

" Probably not the best spot for Tibetan $T$ . Momo ' s were spread out on plate , I don ' t know if it ' s for presentation or if it ' s to make it look more . It didn ' t worked for either purpose . We went for some warm Tibetan food on cold rainy evening but didn ' t really helped .

" I was expecting more . The design is amazing , the $T$ was ok . The food was standard for these kinds of places nothing exciting , the ceviche over dressed , not subtle at all . The sushi and scallops were very good . But most of all the service was just odd - drinks took forever and a lot of staff had a " " not my job " " response for requests or questions . I ' ll give them another try in a few months when they ' ve settled in . For now , it feels like there ' s room for improvement . "

" We enjoyed the $T$ and the service . Just one thing marred our visit . I called the restaurant before leaving the house to ask if it was a BYOB and was told , yes , you can bring your own bottle . So we were unpleasantly surprised to find a corkage fee of $ 10 . 00 on our bill . When I questioned the waitress , she responded that they always charge this fee . When I told her about my call to the restaurant , she lowered it to $ 5 . 00 ; still left a bad taste . "

Wonderful place with excellent $T$ ! The vibe in here is relaxing with great staff . We decided to sit at the bar and we are glad we did because the bartender there was excellent . Drinks were on point and the food was even better . My wife had the penne and I had the gnocchi . Price was fair for 2 people . Will definitely be coming back here again . Well run establishment .

" Vegetarian restaurant . Nice interior and ambiance .    Flavorful food , however they ' re a bit on the greasy side . The fried rice was greasy even when asked to go light on the oil . $T$ was a little too wet to my liking but there was flavor . The same goes for the roti .    If you don ' t mind the grease and glistening rice , the food is fine . "

" $T$ was not bad . Could have provided larger portions all around considering the prices . Now for the reason to not go : SERVICE - Trying to ask a question , no one to be found , yet there were 10 or more waiters . Trying to get a drink , takes one drink order , there were 4 of us and the other 3 had to wait until the waiter returned . Placing an appetizer order and placing a dinner order , forgettaboutit ! ! You are waiting ! ! Did I say there were 10 plus waiters in the restaurant . Try asking a question , exactly , try asking a question . Oh , I forgot , ONE bartender ( it was a Friday night ) , very nice young lady , but there is no way you should have one bartender behind the bar handling table and bar orders on a Friday night . BTW Manager made pretend he cared when these issues we brought to his attention . My recommendation : Skip this place . The star above is because I could rate it - 5 ! ! "

" $T$ was excellent , but the maintenance is terrible . As soon as I stepped in the whole place had a weird smell . The floor was dirty so as the table . We had to move to another table by ourselves as there was no staff to assist . Bathroom floor was wet and tissues all over the floor . I guess Olive Garden doesn ' t even care much to this location . If this continues to go on then sorry olive garden . "

" I have stopped going to olive garden long back . I was forced to go this time to use my gift card and boy it did disappoint as expected . Filthy place as shown . $T$ was below average . I just couldn ' t eat it . Wasted 80 % of it and never bothered packing as I know I won ' t like it . The only good part was the desert . Other than that it was a dud . This is my last visit to olive garden . If I get a olive garden gift card next time , I will donate it away . "

" $T$ ! ! ! It came crawling onto my son ’ s spoon as we were eating . And usually if you see tiny cockroaches , then you may have an infestation . So we stopped eating immediately and left . We almost didn ’ t pay bc they made us wait 30 - 40mins to pay ! Moving on the food : egg rolls were old and juicy , pad Thai was mediocre , rice dish was okay , but the basil dish wasn ’ t all that bad . Service was okay but not the greatest , especially for us being the only ones dinning in . Napkins were so old they were stiff , and silverware were super dirty so we asked for chopsticks . I ’ m sure these a great people but may be in an old place or need more staff . A lot of potential . Would not recommend only bc of the small cockroach I had to kill mid dining . "

The restaurant is much worse than it used to be . The owner and chef have changed . The $T$ have gone up and the portions have gotten ridiculously smaller . It looks like it ' s designed for a 3 year old . Yesterday we made an order and at home we saw that only 4 small pieces of shish kebab were included in the portion . All . !

I don ’ t frequent Olive Garden . This is only my second time going to one aside from the one in Garden city . The $T$ wasn ’ t bad . Except we had to change our table . There were several micro ants on my side of the table . I almost didn ’ t notice . That why I gave it a 3 . We got an apology which is great from the waiter but tbh the Mgr should have offered their apologies . I still felt a bit uncomfortable but I wasn ’ t dining alone . Overall it was ok . The prices are decent and the lunch menu is good .

" This place is a hidden gem - if you ' re in the mood for a cheap , Korean meal ( particularly great for lunch cause it ' s very much grab and go ) this is the place to be . Pictured below is the kimchi fried rice and bulgogi $T$ . It ' s also 5 % off your bill if you pay in cash and a $ 15 credit card minimum . "

The restaurant itself has a nice aesthetic and the $T$ is very well presented but definitely doesn ' t live up to expectations flavor / price wise . The lobster is fried in the shell so the coating ends up staying there and the waffles didn ' t have anything going for them without the ( very good ) caramel or syrup . Worth a revisit for the dinner menu since we did go too early for some of the other options .

It ' s a family business , they ' re incredibly friendly , the menu is huge ( and includes lots of Mexican specialties ) , the food is great , the portions are massive , and the $T$ is really nice ( including their outdoor seating ) . This is the kind of homey , cozy restaurant that seems to be disappearing from the city ( RIP Teresa ' s in BK Heights ) , so I ' m so happy to see it in the Slope . Please support this great business ! "

" We were waiting table for 40 $T$ , it ’ s not a big deal . BUT we waiting a waitress to take an order for another 25 and she took an order only because we asked a busboy to get the waitress , she forgot to add sushi to the order and we got our drinks when we finished the food . It was one of my favorite places of Asian food . First time ever , I so disappointed . "

While I understand that during dinner rush $T$ can get overwhelmed and be slightly less attentive than they would be during other hours it was hard to barely have any service at all . Our table was never cleared so when our main course arrived I had to pick up and move our plates around and then take the plates from the runner and place them where they needed to go . Either more staff or better management is required .

I went to Mariachi 2 years ago with my dad and I loved the $T$ and the ambiance . But today we ordered their food again and my chicken tacos were so underwhelming . They came with super tiny corn tortillas and the chicken fell out . The chicken was really bland and dry . The rice and beans looked good but when I tasted them I didn ' t like them either ; everything was so bland . I was so disappointed by this meal . The only thing that tasted good was the guacamole .

Great $T$ and staff ! Made it in time for the lunch special and it was great . The smaller sizes were perfect and it ' s a shame it ' s not available on the regular menu for those with weight management concerns . Great waitress and hostess - we tried a new wine ( remember to ask for your wine sample ) and ended up buying the bottle . It was cheaper for the 3 of us . Well definitely be back !

" Our $T$ was not attentive at all . We had a party of 10 , no extra napkins , only the ones the utensils are wrapped in . Never came back to ask if we wanted extra bread , soup or salad nor to refill our drinks . When one one person in our group asked for another soup it took forever to bring , to the point we all finished our dinner and the soup had not arrived . Never got the chocolates you normally get with your bill , which is no big deal , but the kids look forward to those . "

Bread with cheese was tiny ( and took 45 minutes even though it ’ s zero prep )  Fried artichoke was oily .  Chicken itself was good , but the sides were cold . "

Happen to walk by and noticed how busy it was in Tony ' s Pizza in Bushwick and decided to give it a try . Waited a while for our order but the $T$ were very nice to my wife and I with updates on our order . After getting our order with extra perks because of our extended wait time we were very pleased with our order especially the quinoa and mushroom slice which my wife really enjoyed . Thanks guys . Keep up the great food and hospitality . We will be back .

" The $T$ was delicious . However . The leaves a lot to be desired . We had a party of 20 . The waiters did not know what each individual ordered . I ordered a medium rare churrasco and they serve it well done instead . The barmaid charged someone drinks on somebody credit card even though the lady paid her cash . Needs more organized servers . I don ' t thing any of the waiters could work in a restaurant downtown . They would not last a day    But the food was rather good . "
