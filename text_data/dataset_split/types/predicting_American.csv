14870,126,39,American,5,05/19/2022,"My friend Patrice had been to Blackbarn before. When she shared a link to the website, I knew we had to go for brunch. I enjoyed the blood orange margarita--fruity and strong with just a hint of spice. We ordered Johnny Cakes for the table--served with whipped ricotta, honeycomb, fresh fruit--simply divine! There was a mix-up in the kitchen and our main dishes got lost in the shuffle. By way of apology, the head chef sent complementary cornbread muffins to our table, then Avocado Toast. He brought our dishes over to the table himself. The manager also came over to our table and said he would provide a deep discount for the inconvenience on the bill. We were also presented with an order of delectable Apple Cider Donuts & caramel sauce on the house. We appreciated that the staff went above and beyond to make things right.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
4617,0,10,American,4,08/22/2022,"Our waiter was awesome! I'm so sorry I can't remember his name cause he was a doll.  Stuffed burgers were good,  although mine was a little overcooked. Seems like restaurants do not want to give you an extremely rare burger.  The best French onion soup. Almost as good as my husband's!  We ate outside  - weather was nice and not too hot.  There's a lovely park across the street  - Memorial Park maintained by the local VFW - and its not only beautifully laid out but carefully maintained. Clean as could be. As it should be, especially since it's dedicated to all the men in town who have made the ultimate sacrifice. Every war since WWI is represented.  Great place to walk off your dinner. Definitely will go again.",The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4618,1,10,American,5,06/23/2022,"I grew up going to the 'Horse and am happy to say it is as fantastic as ever!  Had the best meal of my whole NJ vacation (stuffed cheeseburger and really good fries) and we had excellent service courtesy of Mike!  Complimentary cole slaw and pickles so good.  (No ""iron horse mints"" but that must be b/c of covid....) Highly recommend my hometown and the Iron Horse!",The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4619,2,10,American,5,05/19/2022,50 years in business for a reason! We were their first outdoor diners for this season! Beautiful park across the street makes for a nice atmosphere.  Best burgers around!,The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4620,3,10,American,1,04/19/2023,"Worst meal I have had in a long time.  I don't usually write reviews but had to this time.  My glass was dirty, fried eggplant was so greasy and thought they could redeem themselves with their fries.... well they couldn't.  Service was sub par.  The Cole slaw and pickles were good.  Would I go back.... no.",The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4621,4,10,American,5,02/18/2023,"Best burger around. Place has been there for half a century and it's pretty obvious why. Fair prices, quality food. Burgers are actually stuffed with cheese. Incredible.",The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4622,5,10,American,4,05/12/2023,Such a cute place with unique food options. We were just passing through so probably won’t get a chance to go back but definitely check it out if you’re in the area!,The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4623,6,10,American,5,05/20/2019,"Great spot, right next to the RR tracks, for a nice cool refreshment, delicious burger, sandwiches, salads or other light fare such as chicken wings. Warm, cozy feeling in this somewhat sprawling and interesting layout of multiple rooms for dining and imbibing. All sorts of nostalgic pictures and memorabilia. I had lobster bisque soup which was excellent.  We both had a plain burger with the piping hot, scrumptious french fries. Also, the sangria was nice and fruity.  Tasted a bit like Yago. (See photos) The service was attentive and quick. In sum, we were well satisfied.",The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4624,7,10,American,4,05/19/2020,"The service is very attentive. The seating layout is a bit complicated, and I was a little cramped in my booth with a 6-top right next to me. The food was great! I don't know what they put on their fries but I loved the smoky flavor. The stuffed burger kind of squirted the cheese out of the back, but no harm no foul - you just pick up some of that delicious river of cheese and smear it on your next bite of burger. The blueberry crisp a la mode is amazingly good. It's insanely sweet (which I love), but omg the portion size? I've had bowls of oatmeal with way less of a portion size!",The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4625,8,10,American,5,05/19/2022,"Excellent experience, delicious food and great prices. Had a burger stuffed with cheddar cheese that melted in your mouth as you bite into it. The steak fries were good also. The lemonade was Great too. Pickles and coleslaw served on the side, and you can even have seconds, with no charge for the slaw and pickles. I was so excited and pleased as a hamburger lover.  Highly recommend this place. While looking at other guest and their meals, can't wait to try other menu items.",The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4626,9,10,American,5,05/19/2022,A little pricey for a pub burger place but the burgers were great. Very clean and attentive service. I will definitely be back.,The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4627,10,10,American,5,07/23/2022,Excellent food and service every visit! A neighborhood classic — an old reliable!!! The pickles alone make a trip worthwhile!!!!,The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4628,11,10,American,4,10/21/2022,"family friendly vibe, local favorite, historic location, excellent menu, great service, clean bathrooms.  we prefer going a bit earlier to avoid crowds",The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4629,12,10,American,5,11/20/2022,"We had a large family gathering of out-of-towners to feed after an emotionally draining service at a local cemetery. The staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome and well taken care of. The food was outstanding and prepared to everyone's liking, which is not easy with 10+ burgers (well, medium-well, medium-rare, etc) being served at once. They obviously work hard, and work hard to find and keep excellent staff. Cheers to the Iron Horse!",The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4630,13,10,American,5,05/19/2020,"What a wonderful local haunt, we kept it to the burgers and beer, which is what this place is, not fancy, but nice. Best of all the Great Service. Our waitress was a delight and a lot of fun.",The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4631,14,10,American,5,05/19/2020,"Good service, food came out pretty quickly. The wings and stuffed burgers were very flavorful. Our waitress and other staff were very friendly and conversational.",The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4632,15,10,American,5,02/18/2023,A must go if you are in the area.  The food is legendary. Get the railroad fries. Burgers and wings are as good as it gets.,The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4633,16,10,American,5,05/19/2021,The tables follows the rule of social distance. The food is not expensive at all and the it also gives a large portion.,The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4634,17,10,American,5,05/20/2019,Excellent historical pub in downtown Westwood.  Can't go wrong with any of their stuffed hamburgers.  Always have a special plate and beer selection.  I keep going back for the friendly service and excellent food.  Great place to spend with family and friends.,The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4635,18,10,American,5,08/22/2022,"I haven't been here in 25 years. However, some great things never change. Still have the delicious coleslaw and pickles for everyone to start! As amazing as I remember. I had the special cheesesteak burger stuffed with American cheese and topped with sauted onion peppers and some provolone cheese. Incredible!!!! I am in the area now and will definitely be back sooner than 25 yrs. Do yourself a favor and pay them a visit. You won't regret it!!!",The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4636,19,10,American,5,02/18/2023,"Very friendly food great and very clean ,also like the pictures on the wall lot of historical.",The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4637,20,10,American,5,08/22/2022,Stopped in for lunch with my sister. We sat at a table in the bar area. We experienced fast efficient service with a smile. I ordered a cheeseburger cooked the was I asked. My sister had potato skins. We were very happy with the quality of the food.,The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4638,21,10,American,4,11/20/2022,This place is such a staple for the local community. No frills but always puts up a good effort. Their current anniversary beer is fantastic,The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4639,22,10,American,3,12/20/2022,Food and service are fine conveniently located by train station. The weak link is it is in serious need of interior update. Looks kind of sad...,The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4640,23,10,American,5,05/19/2021,Best stuffed hamburger around. Cole slaw and pickles are tradition,The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4641,25,10,American,1,06/23/2022,"This place is really old, the waiter was really nice and attentive, but the place is falling apart… the food is horrible… I ordered an steak sandwich is the steak tested like pure blood, the nachos were horrible.. I won’t recommend it, the salsa was super dried",The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4642,26,10,American,1,08/22/2022,"Empty on a Tuesday night, despite which service was terribly slow. Food was still decent, but the empty tables were filthy. Very sticky lacquer, perhaps due to the heat of summer, but this time, there were shreds of paper napkins from previous patrons sticking to the table at every seat (and from what I could see, at every  empty table in the room). No reason to change my table. Have some pride in your appearance! Maybe if you took the time to look and act professional, you'd have more customers. Clean your damn tables!  I've  been going there for years, and even in the past 2 post-Covid  years, the staff has been professional. Not anymore. Should have walked out. Not going back soon. Gonna take a shower now.Step it up, Iron Horse, or close it down!",The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4643,27,10,American,5,05/19/2022,I heard about their stuffed burger and wanted to check it out. Wasn’t disappointed at all! Probably the best burger I’ve eaten. Couldn’t stop eating it and the meat was just as good as the cheese center. Definitely make sure to come here and grab a bite! French onion was amazing as well. It was one of the best I’ve ever had if not the best.,The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4644,28,10,American,4,05/19/2022,Burgers were great but the onion rings and zucchini we're terrible. I blame old oil and being at the end of the night. The burgers and service deserve a 4 out of 5 star.    They are short staffed like evey other restaurant but they tried there best and went out of the way for us.,The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4645,29,10,American,5,05/19/2022,"I try to get to the Iron Horse whenever I'm back in north Bergen County. The food is great - but don't make the mistake of calculating calories - the portions are very satisfying, and satisfying the prices are very reasonable. The free starter of pickles and Cole slaw is great. The train themed atmosphere is also enjoyable.    ,  and the prices are very reasonable.",The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4646,30,10,American,4,01/19/2023,Good comfort food...reasonably priced...excellent service...great ambiance,The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4647,32,10,American,4,05/19/2022,The stuffed burgers are the reason to come. Really liked the pretzels and cheese during Octoberfest. Parking can be a huge pain. Prices are on the high side for burgers. The pickles and coleslaw are fantastic.,The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4648,33,10,American,5,05/19/2022,It was a total fluke finding this gastronomic oasis. Even the curbside parking space was pleasantly empty waiting for my car. I was promptly greeted by Brandon my server.    Decided to go with a burger and when asked whether they had crumbled blue cheese he said sure we stuff the meat patty with it and... would you like double cheese?    Double cheese? I asked and he explained it goes in the patty and on top of it for a cheesey galore experience. God bless him!    A few minutes passed and it came...my very own state of the art Bacon Double Blue Cheeseburger Deluxe.    That first bite was just glorious and I thought...is it the cheese? So I grabbed my three legged fork and tasted the meat by itself.    I was totally impressed by how well the meat was seasoned and cooked. Delicious enough to be eatened by itself!    My meal had more to offer by way of perfectly fried steak french fries which nicely complimented my awesome burger.    Well I thought the whole thing was too good to be true so I went back for more the next day. BTW the service was great both times. Yum!,The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4649,34,10,American,2,08/22/2022,Our burgers were just ok. Way too many gnats flying around my table. If they are in the dining room I assume there are more in the kitchen. It didn't seem too clean to me. I'll pass.,The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4650,35,10,American,5,05/20/2019,"I have been going to The Iron House since i graduated high school in 1972.  It remains one of the more consistent restaurants i have ever been to.  If you like a good burger served in a warm, cozy setting, then this is the place. They're always friendly, the food is great and it is reasonably priced. My favorite is the stuffed cheeseburger. Try it!",The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4651,36,10,American,5,05/20/2019,"I finally stopped in after living here almost 2 years. I don’t generally go to bars or places that have bars. However, I took a chance. The food was very good, very inexpensive in comparison to other restaurants in this area. I ordered nachos. The plate was piled extremely high. The nachos were excellent. I couldn’t eat even half of what I received. Server was friendly, and the place was clean. Surprisingly, for a tavern, it also seemed very family-friendly. I wouldn’t hesitate to take children there to eat.",The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4652,37,10,American,1,05/19/2022,"So, this place has obviously been around forever. Honestly, it’s in need of a makeover…and some air freshener. Immedielty when you walk in, you’re hit with this smell of old carpet, old man, funeral home type smell. It’s so off putting. I haven’t been here since I moved to the area almost 18 years ago. A friend of mine and I came in cause we were craving some French onion soup.    The soup was good, but not good enough to come back. The smell was so strong, it was uncomfortably quiet, you could hear everyone’s conversation in the dining room. We were going to walk out after a couple minutes but we felt we were already too deep in after they brought out some water. You know, it’s just the thought that if it smells this bad, how dirty and smelly is everything else?    I wish I could renovate this place myself. Honestly go to any other pub nearby, anything is better then sitting in a smelly old resturant.",The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4653,38,10,American,4,12/20/2022,Great food and drinks. Great staff. Highly recommend.,The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave

4656,41,10,American,5,06/23/2022,Delcious food!  Substituted the fries for a baked potato. Ordered the turkey burger which was filling and really good!,The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4657,42,10,American,4,05/19/2020,It's a nice place when you have not eaten for 3for 4 days ! Portions are so huge that it is a record if you can finish your plate... quality is good. What's the point are the stuffed burgers. No need of an appetizer,The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4658,43,10,American,5,05/19/2020,Hadn't been since a kid. I love that they still have their prize winning stuffed cheese burgers and coleslaw and pickles unlimited.   The sides of truffle fries or onion rings that come with the meal are plenty. Server was excellent and informative. Would recommend to anyone in the area.,The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4659,44,10,American,4,05/20/2018,"Nothing special. Have to say, we came at the end of the day. But nothing overwhelmed us at all. Hamburgers were good but not extraordinary, well done instead of medium well. The service was good but nothing special as well. So it's good place to go to eat hamburgers, but you need more luck than we have had.",The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4660,45,10,American,5,05/20/2018,I can't believe it took me so long to check this place out. It is so cool inside. Clearly has been a local staple for years. It has an old pub feel and the burgers are amazing. They put the cheese inside the burger which is something they are known for...and now I know why. Delicious! Our waiter was super friendly and kind and I will be going back the next chance I get.,The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4661,46,10,American,4,05/21/2015,I have never had a bad burger there.  The railroad fries are great.  The service is good.  I love the pickles.  I'd like to know how they make them - they're just the right amount of crunchy/sour/salty. I have never tried anything else at the Iron Horse.,The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4662,47,10,American,5,05/20/2019,I was hesitant cause the stuffed burger seemed like a novelty but was happily proven wrong. Great atmosphere. Great staff. Amazing food. The portion size may look small at first but it was surprisingly satiating.,The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4663,48,10,American,4,05/21/2014,"I love it here, best buffalo wings around - no contest.  They have great happy hour specials.  Their homemade pickles and coleslaw are delicious.  I really like their Turkey Reuben and their hamburgers are great.  Only 4 stars because of the price, but it is in a town where restaurant price inflation is rampant - gotta pay the rent!",The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4664,49,10,American,5,05/19/2021,Ordered the lobster roll and fries. Ready in 10 mins and they gave me a 10% discount as a walk-in. Delicious,The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4665,50,10,American,4,05/20/2019,"This is a family restaurant. It has that comfy cozy feel about. The menu has enough items to choose from without feeling confusion. I had a stuffed burger. I absolutely loved it!! Perfect combination of cheese and burger. The side of cole slaw and pickle were perfect. The cole slaw is crisp and flavorful. The service was incredible. Checking to see how we were. If we needed drinks. I had rice pudding for dessert. The cinnamon was just right. Not to much, not to little. Very enjoyable. I had a great time. I'm looking forward to going back again with friends.",The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4666,51,10,American,5,05/19/2022,"Oh boy, both of our drinks were really good! Cosmo & Long Island Iced Tea  Chicken soup was a little bland. Appetizer Pretzels & burger & fries were . …",The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4667,52,10,American,5,05/19/2020,Train theme decorations wrapped the dining room.  Food was spot on. Everything came out perfectly. Our waitress was very pleasant and attentive. Good atmosphere to bring kids. Would recommend.,The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4668,53,10,American,5,05/19/2022,Very good food at the iron horse very good burgers very good coleslaw and I keep placing span and happy 50th anniversary to the iron horse from Edinburgh to the rest of the safe I miss you guys please stay safe and wear a mask and I love you very much and Sean thank you very much for all that you do and help me out through the years I miss you guys have a great day,The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4669,54,10,American,5,05/20/2019,I may be a little biased in my review since this place has such sentimental value to me but Ive been going here for over 20 years. I dont live in New Jersey anymore but I always make sure to visit whenever I'm up north. I've always loved the coleslaw and pickles there. And the burgers are YUMMY. They've perfected the whole cheese in the middle thing.,The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4670,55,10,American,5,05/20/2018,"First time here, the hamburgers are simply out of this world. Apparently they are famous for them and I can understand why. If you are in the neighborhood you must stop in. If you are not and are in the mood for the BEST hamburger of your life you need to go there. Did I mention all hamburgers are stuffed with cheese? Simply Amazing!! Btw, not expensive at all.",The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4671,56,10,American,5,05/19/2021,Absolutely phenomenal wings. A bit pricey but you pay for quality - I've never had a wing order from this place disappoint me. They're very generous with the complimentary coleslaw and pickles as well.,The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4672,57,10,American,2,05/19/2022,Food its good but the only problem the service has to be more faster I order food for pick up I drive about 20 minutes and then I wait 15 minutes outside and the order still not ready the workers keeps telling me needs 10 minutes and take about hours and 15 minutes for just 4 items and the things thay make pay and wait for my order I really feel sorry for the owner he has to bring more workers in the kitchen but I will never come back again.,The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4673,58,10,American,5,05/20/2018,"The owners are amazing and the food is good. They actually contribute and participate in the community which I think is a rare thing these days. I recommend the Dispatcher for a hangover cure or the Nachos for a great appetizer. Not that many but families care about bathrooms, but they have a family size restroom that is big enough to change a little one and clean.",The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4674,59,10,American,5,05/20/2017,"I have been going to The Iron Horse for at least 30 years! They never disappoint. Pure comfort food. Relaxed atmosphere, great servers and great food. Our favorite is their cheeseburger...they are stuffed with the cheese! Best potato skins also.  This is our go to place.",The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4675,60,10,American,4,05/22/2008,"I took my mother here and she was expecting the average burger joint.  She was pleasantly surprised by the helpful staff, great chicken sandwich, and out of this world chocolate cake.  I really enjoy their stuffed cheese burgers and home made coleslaw and pickles.",The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4676,61,10,American,4,05/19/2020,"Good food with good service, my first time here after hearing how great the burgers were and I was not disappointed. Wings and mozzarella sticks were also very good. Would definitely recommend it if you're looking for a can't miss pub type spot.",The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4677,62,10,American,4,05/20/2018,"This place has been in business for over 35 years and is a great family place. Same owners since opening. Food is always made to order and have specials all the time. Casual gathering place, bar is good for watching some sports or ordering some good craft beers on tap.",The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4678,63,10,American,1,05/20/2016,My husband ordered the fried calamari and I tasted it and thought it was fishy and inedible. He didn't wan't to complain and just suffered through it. His stomach was gurgling before we even got home and he became sick.  This place has gone seriously down hill. They no longer seem to even care if they sicken their customers. The waitstaff is sullen and depressed in attitude. I am never going back.  Maybe have a beer there but do not trust the food in this place.,The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4679,64,10,American,3,05/20/2018,"The wings are fantastic, but.... $13.00 for a burger with lettuce/tomato and fries was a bit excessive. I didn't get cheese on it and there wasn't anything particularly interesting about the burger. $3.00 for a coke, also excessive. Overall I wouldn't go back just because it's way overpriced for a bar type burger joint.",The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4680,65,10,American,5,05/20/2018,"The burgers here are phenomenal. They are stuffed with your choice of cheese, and the meat is good quality for a good price. The fries are also delicious. Highly recommend!",The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4681,66,10,American,5,05/19/2020,"Great evening at The Iron Horse.  Went here for a family members birthday and as always the food was plentiful and delicious.  Waitress was friendly, helpful and spot on.    We had the Cubans with sides of fries, OctoberFest stuffed burger with mini potato pancakes, blue cheese stuffed burger and Chicken wrap, both also with fries.  Instead of bread they served cole slaw and pickles.    The dining rooms are large and offer ample space to navigate around.  The ambiance is local noteworthy items and lots of trains, with a fireplace to keep you warm on cold winter nights.    Check their website for trivia nights, fun & games as well as dinner theatre events!",The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4682,67,10,American,4,05/20/2019,Amazing place. They even have a wood burning stove inside for the winter! The owner and his wife really do a great job. I had the chili for lunch and the chipotle/cheddar stuffed burger. Highly recommend!,The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4683,68,10,American,1,05/20/2016,"It looks cool inside, some would say it needs a face lift. But my experience is; places that  look like this, usually have great food! Not in this case...I ordered the special, prime rib. Pros - it came out quickly and was cooked correctly, but that's where it ends. The whole dish was cold. The plate was ice cold which affected the temperature. The vegetable medley came from a bag, most likely frozen...worst of all the mashed potatoes were from a box and cold. Some other review said they love the homemade Cole slaw...I don't what they had, but the slaw I had tasted liked the kind that comes out of a 5 gallon pail (pre-made) or at a company catered BBQ. This place, according to the reviews, is known for their wings and burgers. If I ever come back, I won't get the special...finally, I eat out a lot, this is the first review I've written in about 3 years, if that tells you anything!",The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4684,69,10,American,5,05/20/2019,"Local delish, always there when you need it The Iron Horse is a neighborhood staple.  Love the stuffed cheese burgers and sweet potato fries. Buffalo wings are the best. Best rail road fries,  nacho platter! Omg. Drinks and service are also consistently good. One day I'll make it to their mystery nights.",The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4685,70,10,American,2,05/20/2019,"as a place in business for 35 years right in Westwood right next to the Train Station, spruce the place up!  Time for some nice renovations and maybe you can justify $15 Burgers.  The place smells old.  Its not character, its old.  I don't come here much and there's a reason.  Met a friend before a wake.  I didn't want to go here but I wound up at the bar anyway and regretted it.  Stay in business but time for some updates.    Met someone here last night for a beer.  A year and a half after my above review.  While the Dining room might be nicer, the bar area is gross.  We were going to eat (against my best wishes) but the ""complementary"" pickles and slaw were soggy and the guy next to us got ice cold ribs he had to send back and those $15 Burgers are way over priced.  Step it up guys.  You have a prime location and apparently a pretty good following.  Spruce it up and you may find an increase in customer base.

4687,72,10,American,1,05/20/2018,"Just going to give 1 star for the French fries. The burger had no flavor, the baked onion soup had no flavor, and the Cole slaw was subpar. I had to put salt and pepper on everything and for a medium burger it came out pretty rare. Having to spend $15 on that burger was the biggest joke of it all because it was one of the smallest burgers I've ever had. You have better luck going anywhere else for a burger",The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave
4688,73,10,American,1,05/20/2019,"Just left this place. Service was absolutely terrible took almost 2 hours for the food to come out, and the waiter barely came to our table to ask us about drinks etc. This was especially shocking being that we had a party of 15 and were spending good money. Then when we got the bill we were told gratuity was automatically added. When we paid the bill we were off by $5 and since the service was terrible I figured a 19.5% tip was more than enough, but apparently not because the waiter had the audacity to come back and complain even after the terrible service she provided. I will never go here again, mediocre food with awful service!!!!",The Iron Horse Restaurant,20 Washington Ave

She first told me to ""move my son's chair"" just like that. Not please or any thing or even gave me the chance to do it without the snippy ness. Then our meals came out and my son's meal was wrong. I asked her to please just add cheese because I asked for  cheese burger. She first questioned me if I asked for a cheeseburger then she took out her pad to see if I actually did. Then she brought back a deflated sad looking burger with a piece of cheese on top instead of being stuffed that my son was excited for.    Food was good.  Service was ok.

There were three of us, and we ordered two appetizers, entrees, and cocktails. Everything was delicious and nicely presented, with good sized portions. I ordered a gin and club soda which came to me with tonic instead, and my friend's salad was missing the steak he ordered with it, but overall this was a nice experience, I enjoyed the vibe and ambiance of the place. There was also a duo performing live music which was a nice touch as well.",Grillestone Restaurant - Bar - Private Events,2377 US-22

9641,4,24,American,1,10/21/2022,"They should take their breakfast menu off of the menu. It was not worth what we paid. . My turkey bacon was burnt. Coffee was cold. They did not have any of the condiments on the table. So we had to wait for the waiter to go and get it.The syrup was not even enough to put on one of the cold pancakes.  By the time that they brought it to the table the coffee and tea was really cold. My husband pork bacon was good with not complaint But the toast was so hard that it almost brought our teeth.  And we have good teeth.The home fries was really the best thing on the breakfast menu. Pancake were not even the size that I thought that I was going to get. They brought out silver dollars for $12.00. They could have kept them. They look as if they were taken out of a freezer and put into a microwave. They whole breakfast cost us  $75 dollars four people. I could see if it was 5 star restaurant. They should stick to lunch and dinner. Serving Breakfast is not for them. Everything one the Breakfast menu has a price for everything that they have on their menu. Pancake $12.99, bacon 6.99, etc. I was not please with anything on the menu.

9642,5,24,American,1,04/28/2023,"This a note to the owner of this venue:    After securing a date for my private event at your restaurant my communication with the catering manager led me to cancel my event at your location. As whenever I would reach out with a question she would respond in an unprofessional tone and when confronted about it she made no effort to rectify the situation which resulted in me cancelling my event that was a shy 3 weeks away. When she finally did respond all I received was a ""Thank You!"" This business does not deserve to earn my money or anyone else's for that matter. They weren't giving me free service as I am a paying customer that had previously held a event there years ago but was now left to secure another venue (which I finally did and was treated in a decent and professional manner) not like they cared in the least. It is important for catering managers to be responsive and helpful in answering any questions that customers may have about their menu options. It is disappointing that my inquiry was answered in such a condescending tone on multiple occasions. This makes customers feel unwelcome and discouraged from continuing to do further business with the restaurant.    Additionally, it is the responsibility of the catering manager to provide excellent customer service. A simple ""thank you"" email is not the most professional way of handling any situation, as the catering manager could have taken the opportunity to gather feedback from me about what could have been done better or offer additional support for planning future events. Overall, if planning a private event you might want to look at other options where the catering managers are willing to prioritize customer satisfaction. Ensuring that they are addressing their concerns in a helpful and respectful manner. Very sad to see that Grillestone missed the mark on this one I expected better.",Grillestone Restaurant - Bar - Private Events,2377 US-22

I also planned my sister in law's birthday party here and the party room is a good size. The price is reasonable. The only con is the manager took a very long time to answer my emails. I was planning the event to the last second because she took so long to reply. She also made an error on my package. I am still waiting for my refund on that.",Grillestone Restaurant - Bar - Private Events,2377 US-22

I actually felt underdressed when I walked in and said it to the waitress, and she immediately made me feel welcome.    Our waitress was very friendly and checked on us often.  The food was great, and the ambience was very relaxing.  Restaurant was clean and overall was a great experience.  I definitely would recommend for any occasion.  They also have a kids menu, which I thought was great.",Grillestone Restaurant - Bar - Private Events,2377 US-22
9651,14,24,American,3,05/19/2021,"Usually a very nice experience. I must say that the service and food were not good this time around. Once we were seated, we literally had no one come to our table for over twenty minutes. We finally asked the young man bussing the tables to get us a server.    When the server came she took our order. Mind you that she was the hostess not a server. Our drinks and starters came out about 15 minutes later, and everything was really good.    They delivered our food thirty minutes later and I was disappointed.  I have eaten here over six times and never had a complaint.  I ordered the mediterran quinoa salad with salmon which is usually really good, this time the salmon was over cooked and really, really dry. We also asked for a side of balsamic for the salad, and a club soda with lime. We never got either.    I let the hostess know that the service was unacceptable, and she said that they were very busy and under staffed. In my opinion that is not a reason for poor service.    I will be back again, hopefully to the experience I know they can and have delivered.",Grillestone Restaurant - Bar - Private Events,2377 US-22

9659,24,24,American,1,11/20/2022,"A personal note to the owner.    We visited your location last night only to leave disappointed and collectively puzzled.    First let us start by saying your hostess was so unaware of her surroundings, once a table is sat it should be her responsibility  to keep an eye on it and make sure someone actually goes to the table, instead she was too busy being perched back on her chair which by the way is such a bad look, chairs at host stations are nothing more than tools to make the staff lazy.    The young lady who to our understanding is the manager and also a family member could also not be bothered to pay attention as she was too busy mingling by the bar, a shame really. No server, bus person, etc bothered to approach our table so after 15 minutes or so we left.    As we were leaving the hostess said "" oh are you sure? "" umm yes lol! and then she said ""oh I am sorry, tonight we are swamped"" which your place was not. Not only was your team not swamped but many of the tables around us had finished eating. Sometimes it is better to say nothing than to say something so obtuse.    Your prices are quite high for such unimpressive service; Sides not being included and all that, we found ourselves unable to justify the prices we were going to pay you after 15 minutes waiting with no service.    --------    We also found ourselves not finding many interesting options and I know this might sound silly but your font selection, inconsistency in capitalization, the random use of bold letters, and the prices being in a larger font than the item itself are simply bad menu design choices that were highly distracting while browsing through your menu. Also, you are wasting a lot of money in printing paper menus and it isn't environmentally conscientious but that's your prerogative I suppose.    Oh, one last thing that giant structure behind the hostess is also very odd and its really ruining the flow of your space by taking away from the dining room as well as the lamps, you could really benefit from some cool sputniks to brighten & elevate the look as it complements the hard look of the stone. [ but that's just my knowledge in commercial space design and you might disagree ]    -------    Anyway, I hope this message is seen as potential for improvement which can always be exciting.",Grillestone Restaurant - Bar - Private Events,2377 US-22

I could only eat a quarter of my meal. I just felt sick and couldn't eat anymore. Burger and fries was really good and so was the steak quesedillas . Truffle mac n cheese was greasy, lackluster. Had to add spices to it when I got home. It's also not appetizing to see the hostess keep picking food from the a la cart buffet. Cookies, meatballs, she just kept serving herself with her fingers or a fork, sit down for awhile, then go back to work repeatedly. The waiter was nice but barely would stay still for an order and forgot about us for refilling drinks and forgot parts of our order since he could just ""remember"" it. Someone  else helped who I think was one of the managers which he was super nice and professional. It's ashame, I really wanted to like this place.

Bacon cooked nicely, sauces were awesome. The BBQ Meatloaf was very good. The meatloaf itself was wonderful, along with the mashed and green bean sides. Also had a Smokehouse burger - nice patty, wonderfully cooked bacon, and great sauce on the burger. Fries were also decent. Mac and Cheese was not outstanding but that's alright, it's mac and cheese. I love the dish so I always try it out even though it's often a gamble in restaurants.    The to-go bag and containers were all very sturdy and held well. The food was all still really awesome even after a 1/2 hour drive back to my house.    Parking lot is big with plenty of space and clear markings. Easy to find and get to.",Grillestone Restaurant - Bar - Private Events,2377 US-22

9692,57,24,American,2,06/23/2022,I gave 2 stars because it looks like maybe it was once a nice restaurant with a nice patio. Didn’t stay to even try the drinks or food. Dirty tables with dishes and glasses and a big serving tray on one of them. Didn’t seem like anyone was even thinking about cleaning up. It was only 8:00 too. Patio is dirty.

9700,65,24,American,1,05/19/2022,Way overpriced food. Disgusting food. How do you get a hot and honey chicken sandwich and can’t even taste the honey? Rude management. Guest should be made aware of menu changes before they order. I went in to get my usual meal they usually cost me around $45 and ended up paying $90 by the end of the night. For all you non-alcoholic drinkers please don’t get any virgin drinks just stick to the regular fountain drinks. Apparently the price of the drinks comes from the syrups and the ingredients they put inside the drinks. So virgin drinks or mocktails are the same price as an alcoholic drink which is outrageous. Which basically tells me you don’t charge for liquor which should be the most expensive part of the drink. So if I go there again  and ask for a shot I expect it to be free because there’s no syrups and no ingredients that go inside I won’t even ask for ice. For reservations they will require you to give a 20% tip but our waiter was so busy with the bar that we had to keep tracking him down instead of the other way around so why should I be required to give 20% for service I had to give myself. Don’t get me started on management because they’re rude to their people and they’re rude to their customers. It’s unfortunate because I had my wedding reception here so its nostalgic to go back to even have dinner there but I have to say I will never come back again.,Grillestone Restaurant - Bar - Private Events,2377 US-22

Lobster were two chunck of pieces over a bunch of watery spicy rice  and chicken Milanese looks like salad.

I had what I assume is their signature steak that was served on a heated stone. There was absolutely no seasoning on the steak, a little salt and pepper would have been all it needed. The Mac and cheese side also had no flavor. The shrimp appetizer we had was pretty good but not a reason to go back.",Grillestone Restaurant - Bar - Private Events,2377 US-22

Sorry, but I didn't enjoy it. For the main course, I had 4 shrimps and a big place of spaghetti. There must be mushrooms, but I found only 3 small pieces. So, for the spaghetti I paid 30$. Is it rational? Bette, to pay this money for steak or lobster..isn't it?  I wanted to love this place...but now I don't. It is my experience.

We removed the menus and asked for our table to be cleaned and get new menus. 10 mins goes by & she comes back to take our order....no cloth to clean the table and no new menus. We order nachos...still no clean table...nachos come but we do not get any plates/saucers, no napkins, no silverware...nothing. We ask for all of the above, another 10 mins goes by so i go inside and re-request them. Now mind you my table is still wet/dirty. Finally our request for the BASICS is fulfilled and she finally has a cloth to wipe the table.  Main course arrives while eating our nachos, I begin to move the nachos but I guess she was in a rush because she began shoving our plates by using the plate our main courses were in.  FOOD - The nachos were GREAT, my braised short rib ravioli was overcooked & mushy, the braised rib had chunks of fat in it...Would not suggest this dish. Hubby says the meatloaf was decent. My bacon seared brussel sprouts had a bit of a burnt taste. After all of that I def did not want any dessert. The couple next to us had the honey chicken & said it was just a piece of chicken dipped in honey and would not suggest it. His wife said the buffalo wings were not hot.

However, there was a disconnect in advising the server. We sat at the booth for a good 15 minutes or so. When the server finally took our order, he did apologize for the confusion. After our order was taken, rolls were brought over - 3 for a party of 4. We asked for a 4th one and it was brought. When the food came, we had to remind our server that one item was missing. It eventually was brought over. We asked for condiments a few times before they were brought over. While we were eating, the manager came over and apologized and offered us ""comped"" dessert, which was appreciated and did alleviate some of the frustration. When we wanted to leave, we had to ask for the check a few times. When it did come, we waited at least 15 minutes before finally getting up and flagging down our server. So in review, food is okay, service slow, staff a bit forgetful, possibly inattentive. Also, BTW - I did overhear a few surrounding booths and table commenting in the slow service and waitstaff that was hard to find. I will not be returning.",Grillestone Restaurant - Bar - Private Events,2377 US-22

9760,130,24,American,4,05/20/2019,Beautiful venue. Server was new and left a bit to be desired (hence the 4 star rating) but other than that would go back again. Small bar towards back to watch sport events. Outdoor section perfect for summer nights. Food portions were great and prices reasonable.,Grillestone Restaurant - Bar - Private Events,2377 US-22
9761,131,24,American,3,08/22/2022,"Updated review 2022: A decent place to catch specials, the game, live entertainment,  a drink with friends or colleagues. Food has declined in quality. Used to be more high-end in nature not closer to an Applebee's.    The location has an outside patio perfect for those warm summer nights or cozy up to the outdoor fireplace in the colder seasons.",Grillestone Restaurant - Bar - Private Events,2377 US-22
9762,132,24,American,2,05/19/2020,"I would always drive by saying I want to go here. Looks classy. Looks are deceiving. Nothing special here. Service took forever and waiting for a salad and medium burger took about 20minutes. Medium burger was WELL DONE and fries were mushy. Caesar salad was just about all hearts, 5 croutons, a sliver of cheese and light on the dressing.  Service left a lot to be desired just like the food. Another waiter checked on his table three times before ours checked in once. More than half the tables were empty, so they were not busy. Prices are fair. Ample parking. Every four of the five tables around us got the nachos. So I’d say get the nachos.",Grillestone Restaurant - Bar - Private Events,2377 US-22
9763,133,24,American,5,05/21/2015,"I've been to Grillestone many times, and they always exceed my expectations. From start to finish, my experience is always enjoyable. I really love the decor inside the restaurant- it creates a great, upscale vibe.The service is great, the staff is friendly, and the food is incredible. The Filet Mignon is one of my favorite dishes, and it is out of this world! My drink of choice is a dirty martini, which always hits the spot. Then, there's the Sushi... Not only is it delicious, but the presentation is amazing as well! The live entertainment on the weekends is awesome too. I highly recommend this tasty restaurant to everyone. You will keep going back for more, because I definitely do!!!",Grillestone Restaurant - Bar - Private Events,2377 US-22

Having being in the field for over 10 years, you really appreciate when other go above and beyond. My hats are off to the CJ, the manager, and Scirocco our server with the beautiful name.

There was honestly not a downside for the special night. Thank you all so much until our next visit.....",Grillestone Restaurant - Bar - Private Events,2377 US-22
9765,135,24,American,4,05/20/2017,It was my first time there and it definitely will not be my last. We tried the buffet and everyone enjoyed the food. The roasted potatoes were a favorite in the group. I am especially happy with the maintenance of the buffet. Everything was fresh.  The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because the service was slow and required patience.,Grillestone Restaurant - Bar - Private Events,2377 US-22
9766,136,24,American,5,05/19/2020,"Love the ambiance! Come here each year for brunch after the NJ Lupus Walk. We've been for lunch and dinner as well. The menu is limited but good selections.

I never write reviews but this time I felt compelled.  I was there to celebrate my birthday with just a few family members and friends.  I knew Valerie Adams and the Dimensions would be there ... JACKPOT!!!! I knew we would eat ... the meal was pretty good.  The burger was less than good but everything else was okay.  Then we met the most amazing server.  I believe her name was Lauren.  She wasn't assigned to our section but was pushed on us.  SHE WAS GREAT!!! She handled the situation graciously, made me feel extra special about my birthday, and got everything we ordered down to the minor details correct.  LOVE this girl!!  Now I hope every time I come the music is great and Lauren is my server!  Thanks Grillstone for having a place that finally gets it right!!.",Grillestone Restaurant - Bar - Private Events,2377 US-22
9768,138,24,American,2,05/20/2019,"Food was good. The waitress appeared to be distracted. She gave my mom the wrong food, never asked us if we wanted beverage refills,  how our food was, or upsell us by suggesting dessert. The place was not THAT busy. At one point she was just gone? The staff appear to have their head elsewhere besides at work. Food service is ALL about the customer. Not your cellphone. Customers make your paycheck!    To management,  I never said the waitress was on the phone. Let me understand this. You're going to correct a customer? I don't believe you were present when we placed our orders. it was not replaced in 3 minutes it was more like 15 almost 20 because the other people at our party were finished when my mother's food, whose birthday it happened to be, who I told to the hostess when I made the reservation a week earlier.And yes the waitress was not very attentive. I have been a chef and in the food service for over 30 years. Please spare me the insulting reply!",Grillestone Restaurant - Bar - Private Events,2377 US-22

9772,142,24,American,5,05/19/2020,I was there yesterday for lunch. I had Chicken Marsala my companion had sirloin tips and the lunch included a salad for only $9.99. The amount of food we got was very good I had 2 thick chicken breasts with gravy cream spinach and a lot of mashed potatoes. The lunch came with a garden salad. The waiter was very good with a nice persona. I would go back again it is an open restaurant with a bar on one side and big tv screens. Definitely a good lunch place for business as I could see they had a few in there. Would reccommend if you live near by or on the hwy and hungry for decent good food to eat.,Grillestone Restaurant - Bar - Private Events,2377 US-22

9774,144,24,American,1,05/20/2019,"1st time here and the waiter  Ahmed  Wasn’t thorough when explaining the menu or policy for this restaurant. We stated this was our 1st time dining.  We came during a  Monday which was open mic I had the broccoli tempura which was disgusting! They put some type of sesame dressing on it, which made it soggy. then my spouse had the  wing special but couldn’t even finish the wings and when we looked to box up our food he said she wasn’t able to take the wings. then when she wanted to box up The loaded potato that she didn’t even touch, The waiter look to her as this he was surprised that she was even going to take the potato Home. Talk about nastiness with the smile!  we’re never coming back here again ! She paid $12.99 for 6wings and the wings were nasty, gummy not crispy. She didn’t even touch the refill.The only two that I have at this establishment in the waiter is to be very transparent the first time customers! Don’t put sesame seed dressing one broccoli tempura!!!!! Yuck!",Grillestone Restaurant - Bar - Private Events,2377 US-22
9775,145,24,American,3,05/19/2020,Celebrated my brothers birthday here with a family lunch. Nice spacious modern restaurant with a bar area with TV's. It was quiet while we were there so we could enjoy ourselves eating and talking. We all had entrees off the lunch special menu. Food and service were ok. They brought a birthday brownie with ice cream to share at the end. Would give it 3.5 stars if that were an option.,Grillestone Restaurant - Bar - Private Events,2377 US-22

9777,147,24,American,3,05/19/2022,The lobster and scallop risotto was the best thing I ate there. I really wanted some Edamame and sushi but they supposedly don't open on Sundays. I found that to be strange for a day such as father's day. They ran out of porkchops. Don't know how they couldn't for see such things happening for a day such as father's day.,Grillestone Restaurant - Bar - Private Events,2377 US-22

9780,150,24,American,1,05/19/2020,DO NOT EAT HERE! My food took almost 1/2 an hour to come and was cold. The lobster tasted like rubber. The crab legs we took home smelled by the time we got home which was a 20 min drive. When I complained they took off a very small percentage off of my bill.

9784,155,24,American,4,05/20/2019,"Overall, Excellent food and service. Very fulfilling burgers. Only concern is when ordering garlic shrimp appetizer, it only comes with five pieces for a dish that cost around $15. We ate on a Monday, which had 50% off all appetizers special. I was surprised to learn that one piece of shrimp would have costed $3 if we didn't dine on Monday.",Grillestone Restaurant - Bar - Private Events,2377 US-22

I ordered the nachos and they were superb (note: portion is ENORMOUS). My bud ordered the Minnesota Burger - could not believe the size of it and it was the best cheeseburger he has had in a long time.  So, ask for Giuseppi, kick back and enjoy a wonderful meal.

9788,159,24,American,2,05/20/2016,"I've tried this place 3 times and I just don't get it. They always appear to be crowded so they are doing something right but I think I just keep getting the ""new guy"".  The service I have received each time I went there was a young server whom appeared to be new and had too many tables for them to handle (different server each time).    While the front of house appears to be a bit of a train wreck the back of the house has it together.  The food has always come out hot, despite the severs best efforts (2 of the 3 visits the servers mixed up the tables while delivering food) and it's always tasted good.    The nail in the coffin for this place for me was my last visit.  The sever brought me the wrong check 2 times, the 3rd time it was the correct check but when the server brought the receipt back for me to sign with my credit card it was the wrong (significantly more expensive) one again. The manager came over and assured me they voided out the transaction but when my credit card statement came at the end of the month there were 2 charges for Grill Stone.  My credit card company took care of it but it's just not worth the hassle to go back to this place.",Grillestone Restaurant - Bar - Private Events,2377 US-22
9789,160,24,American,4,05/21/2013,"Went here with a large party, so naturally we ordered and tried a lot of different foods.  The decor is very well done, and the atmosphere suits the place nicely. The wait time for the meal is slightly above average, so bring plenty of patience with you. The drinks were good and done properly. The wine selection is good and the mark up is very reasonable. The appetizers were all great. The seafood, shrimp and scallops where good. The oysters - if you're into them - were excellent. Since we were going to a steakhouse, we ordered several steaks. The new york strip was recommended as their best steak, so we ordered a few, as well as fillet Mignon. Steaks and well as fillet Mignon were ordered medium-rare but were all cooked medium-well. The meat was dry and tasteless. Luckily they have an abundance of steak sauce to save the day, without it I wouldn't have eaten my meal. We also ordered a half rack of baby-back ribs which also came overcooked and dry. So, if you're going to visit Grillestone, do not order meat. Go with seafood and their selection of nicely prepared cocktails instead.",Grillestone Restaurant - Bar - Private Events,2377 US-22
9790,161,24,American,4,05/20/2019,"Stopped by for a birthday celebration of a dear friend!  Shout out to Madame Leslia!  The atmosphere was nice.  The food was good and displayed without a challenge.  Moreover, the best aspect of this establishment was the outstanding service I received from Mr. Raul at the Omelet Station.    As I placed my order for an egg omelet, I mentioned to Raul that I am allergic to shell fish and since he had handled lobster legs and such, I was concerned of a fatal allergy attack if my food came into contact with the shellfish.  Raul was spot on!!! He immediately took off his gloves and left the post to wash his hands!  When Raul returned he bought with him a fresh batch of egg mixture, new gloves and a smile so bright that everyone standing in line compliment him for bring so thoughtful, considerate and respectful!  Such service demands a huge note of thanks and recognition!  Raul, you set the bar for outstanding customer service and common sense professional skills.  Grillestone should give you all due respect and consideration.  I will be sure to share my experience and look forward to come back one day soon!  Keep up the great work.  You are appreciated!

Both over ripe and under ripe grape tomatoes on it, sparse red onion slices, sparse to none bacon crumbles and had to order more dressing to cover it!  When I see things like this in a restaurant I just know its sliding downhill. I regret even paying for what was tragically served to me today. The bar maid really didnt seem to care, at all.  Matter of fact, I sat at the bar for 10 minutes waiting to be served, the employees where all bunched together watching the T.V.  My advice based on this true expierience, avoid this place completely.  Was once really good, now just lousy.  Poor management, poor service and poorly prepared food.  Too bad..",Grillestone Restaurant - Bar - Private Events,2377 US-22

He informed us of specials and drinks. While there my sis had a small choking mishap. He was quick to act. She was so embarrassed but he was so kind. She excused herself to ladies room but not before he got the door for her. He is a gentleman and a true asset to GrilleStone. He is someone who cares and not just doing his job.

9809,181,24,American,4,05/20/2017,"Meet some friends here to dinner since they just moved over and are new to the area.  Walking into the restaurant has a bit of a diner feel to it, but upon entering it's a bit more ""modernized"" with stonework and dark wall paper.  When my husband and I had gotten there the people I met up with mentioned that they had been waiting 15 minutes for someone to come over just to take their drink order.  Pretty quickly after we had gotten there a waiter did come over and was very attentive the rest of the evening.  We ordered a cheese pizza, some sushi (California roll and spicy tuna), chips and spinach dip and a couple of different types of wings.  Food was definitely just ok, maybe even a little bit below that.  Out of everything we got the chips and spinach dip was the standout for me although everyone at my table seemed to really like the wings (I thought they were ok).  That being said that, we didn't really have entrees, but if I had to judge based on the appetizers not sure I would come back for dinner.  What Grillestone really has going for it, is the outdoor seating area.  This is really cool, has a fireplace with a bar outside.  Definitely a fun space for happy hour since they do fun drinks like fish bowls.  This is somewhere I would definitely come back for drinks and maybe a couple of apps, but it's not really dinner worthy in my mind.",Grillestone Restaurant - Bar - Private Events,2377 US-22

But needs work on most things.",Grillestone Restaurant - Bar - Private Events,2377 US-22
9818,190,24,American,1,05/20/2018,I never write reviews. One star because the waitress was very nice and patience. If I could give it none I would. I had a bad experience here last year and thought it's been a year maybe it's gotten better. Ordered the flank steak menu says it's comes with a red wine demi glaze which shouldn't have mushrooms in it. However the one here does I let them know I had a mushroom allergy before ordering. The meal came out with mushroom gravy. I sent it back due to my allergy they said they made a new one however the steak was well done because they washed off  the gravy and reheated the first one which I know because the mashed potatoes still had some of the gravy on it. I ordered medium. They then said they had no more flank steak but swore they gave me a  new one  I guess they magically ran out when I noticed they brought the same steak back out. My friend ordered the sushi boat and ended up getting sick from it. The fish was slimy which it shouldn't be once it actually defrosted to room temperature they serve alot of fish substitutes for thier sushi. The response from the waitress we've never gotten a complaint about our sushi. Not even a fake apology from the manager. Over all I've learned my lesson and will stay away from this place in the future,Grillestone Restaurant - Bar - Private Events,2377 US-22

After an hour and not getting a text message I went inside and ask just to be told that there was nothing available for me. We apologize...    Quick note people: If you say that it is ok to make someone wait for an hour you better get that person a table. If not, don't sell false promises and waste someone’s time!!

I was embarrassed that I had recommended it.  She ordered a chicken sandwich that was supposed to have proscuitto on it, but it came out with boiled ham.  After she mentioned it she was bought slices of prosciutto on a plate.  I had the filet tips that I've tried before and were very good, but today I got nothing more than grizzle hidden in a gravy over a huge plate of mashed potatoes.  When I told the waiter, glancing at my pile of chewed grizzle on the side of my plate, he said absolutely nothing....just walked away.

9826,198,24,American,3,05/21/2013,"The name is misleading.  I went here hoping for a good steak. Instead i paid $34 for a fried 12oz t-bone that wasn't even a half inch thick.  The menu said 24 ounce,  it was maybe half that precooked. Not even a prime cut.    My wife got lobster ravioli it was frozen pasta with a few graded specks of lobster in the sauce for $24.    That with an appetizer a couple cokes and tip came out to $120.

9827,199,24,American,5,05/20/2016,Great little pizzeria that's been around for 53 years.  Classic NY style pizza.  Perfect for a quick meal and the pizza is excellent - crispy thin crust with tasty tomato sauce and good balance of mozzarella.  The garlic topping is great - funny that you don't see this as a topping or garnish at other places (that I know of).   If you're ever in Fresh Meadows definitely worth a try - highly recommended.,Grillestone Restaurant - Bar - Private Events,2377 US-22

9829,201,24,American,5,05/20/2017,I've been there 3 times in the past monh!  Everything was outstanding!  From the fish tacos to the braised short ribs 2 panini sandwiches everything worth every bite! Special drinks are offered on different days which makes it a home run on food and drinks.

9830,202,24,American,1,05/19/2021,Not in compliance with state regulations-Covid. The hostess was unprofessional. She had my husband and I waiting 40 minutes for a table and continued to tell us she was wiping it down. When in turn she wasn’t. She sat us down rt on top of another couple at the bar. Not even 2ft apart. We immediately left. This place should be shut down!

Today, I decided to stop by and I honestly wish I continued to allow my eyes to be visually wowed because my mouth was not (not in a good way)!  -The waiter did his best and was overall polite but seemed very mechanical in his approach. -The food service on the other hand seemed quite slow especially for the amount of people that were present (roughly 6-8 tables throughout were filled with an average of 3 lol per) so not many. My guess is they should be prepared either way since they run a surf and turf special which I imagine brings larger crowds.  -Now to the food.... let me begin by saying,  prices are decent, I guess. But with accepting greater prices for food, there most definitely comes greater expectation. It's possible my expectations were too high. My daughter ate her wings but she's 10! When I tasted them, it was as if they were prepared much earlier and just warmed up. Not freshly cooked. The fries were fries. Truffle Mac n Cheese....BLAND! The Scotch Plains Roll....mmeeehhhh! The bread,  two steps away from the trash. No visible mold but surely didn't smell or taste fresh. And accompanied by near frozen butter. Even the Moscato tasted cheap and overly sweet.  -The stars of the show were my girls' shirley temples and the Salmon with herb risotto... it was so tasty! So I guess if you go for the salmon and a shirley temple, in my experience....YOU'RE GOLDEN!  I expressed my daughters and I dissatisfaction to the server and he encouraged a 2nd try but I honestly don't think I will.",Grillestone Restaurant - Bar - Private Events,2377 US-22

We came with intentions of having filet mignon, which was out of stock, promptly we were offered either a ribeye or NY strip instead. First we received our bowl of chili, then our meals shortly after. The mashed potatoes and truffle Mac & Cheese was great, but the ribeye was unsatisfying, neither of us ate it. The upsetting part was that the thirty dollar steak, turned into dog food instead.    I would leave a 1/5;  The service was great and the side dishes came out nice... but that steak, the main reason we stopped by, was a nightmare..",Grillestone Restaurant - Bar - Private Events,2377 US-22

There were 4 adults dining. The dining room was freezing and the weather was pleasant outside so we chose to sit on the patio.  The greeter said there were only seas at hi-chair table and sent us outside rather than accompany us to find a table.  The server seemed to have just been hired- like 10 minutes ago because he was clueless, gave us wrong information, like which wine that was was available with Surf& Turf special, did not bring silverware until after serving the firs course.It was almost comical. Ok we go to a restaurant for the food. It was meh and that is a complement. The new menu is confusing and the prices have gone waaay up.  The 2 men ordered short ribs that cam on a pile of mashed potatoes and no vegetable. Now short ribs are cooked thoroughly, these were rare looking ad both orders were sent back for more heat.

All the cocktails were not brought out at the same time, the martini was significantly later than the glasses of wine because, as per the waiter, he was unable to get a martini glass.  We all ordered filet mignon, different sizes, therefore different pricing, with different cooking temperatures; we all received the same size and not necessarily the proper cooking degree.  When reviewing our check, we were charged for something that we did not order or receive, and when questioning the waiter, we were told that they do not even carry that item.

The penne vodka was dry it had very little sauce . The steak was fantastic , I was also very pleased with the chicken marsala. The fish and rice was great . The selection was limited but good . I cannot comment on the sea food but two of my party was very happy with the seafood . The crab  legs and shrimp were great to them . I had a six year old and there wasn't much for him to eat . The pancakes and French toast were bland . I had to order Buffalo wings off the regular menu which my 6year old devoured. They were very Christy and we'll covered with sauce .",Grillestone Restaurant - Bar - Private Events,2377 US-22

We tried their Tamahawk steak which had a hint of barbecue flavor.    The environment was also very nice and cozy for the barn style. Overall great experience.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14530,2,39,American,5,03/20/2023,"I recently attended a client event hosted by our company in the cellar, featuring a demonstration of souffle preparation. The event was attended by a group of 30 individuals, and I must say that it was an absolute delight.    The highlight of the evening was undoubtedly the food. The preset menu included four courses, each one better than the last. The flavors and presentation were exceptional, and every dish was a treat for the taste buds.    However, the real star of the night was the souffle that we had participated in preparing. It was the perfect end to the meal and truly showcased the skills of the chefs. It was light, fluffy, and absolutely delicious.    Overall, I would highly recommend this event to anyone looking for an exceptional dining experience. The food, atmosphere, and company were all fantastic, and I can't wait to attend another event like this in the future. Kudos to the organizers and chefs for putting together such an outstanding evening.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St

Keep this in mind: appetizers are pretty small portion so if you’re going with a big group, order a few.    The entrees are extremely filling. I couldn’t finish my plate. Cider donut is a must!  Minus one star for the slow service.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14533,5,39,American,4,06/23/2022,"My friends and I went to Black barn restaurant today for brunch. The place was very spacious and nicely decorated. They hda private rooms as well which I think that’s nice. Their bloody mary and Mimosa were good. Chicken and waffle was so so, the chicken was a little too dry and the sauce was bland. Shrimp and grits was different than what I usually have at other restaurant. It was good nonetheless. Our favorite was the Egg Benedict, it was soo good! Service was very good too. Overalll I think this place deserves about 3.5 stars. Not spectacular but not bad.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14534,6,39,American,5,02/18/2023,"We went there for the Valentines’s day and apparently their menu was different from other days. We has Octopus dish for the starter and scallop dish and Amish chicken as our main courses. The food was delicious and presented nicely. I enjoyed every dishes, but I would say a little bit salty (I may be an outlier though, since I usually consume less salt compared to average). My only recommendation for them is to work more on their drinks representation, I had the draft cosmopolitan drink which tasted great but I was expecting it to have a nicer look and appearance. The restaurant is bid with two large sitting areas (the one on the back is nicer though!) and the service, decoration, vibe and the choice of songs were pleasant. Idk that was for the valentines day or no lol. Any how, it was a nice experience and I would like to go there again",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St

The food was amazing (espcially the chicken and waffles!) and our server (he's from Kosovo but I cannot remember his name) was attentive and even took us on a tour of the restaurant after our meal. If i could give you 10 stars, I would!",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14537,9,39,American,5,07/23/2022,Blackbarn restaurant is located near Madison square park and museum of math. The food is modern American with a comfort food touch.    We went for a Father’s Day lunch and thoroughly enjoyed the meal and the service.,BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14538,10,39,American,4,04/19/2023,Service: The service was average. We ordered drinks and sometimes they came fast and other times slow. Our waitress wouldn't check in on us very often either and I think we would have ordered more drinks if she had.    Drinks: The drinks were excellent here. We were all very happy with our drink choices.    Food: Everyone seemed to love their food. The portion size is big. I will say I was disappointed with the vegetarian food options. There wasn't a lot of savory options for brunch and everything else was basics pancakes and french toast. I did order the avocado toast and that was very delicious and much better than I even imagined.    Cost: I would say the restaurant was a lot more expensive than anticipated and I don't think the overall experience was worth the cost.

I Understand it’s hard to get good weed stuff these days, but there was hardly anyone in the tavern on a Sunday night, and our waiter seemed like he was may be smoking the devils lettuce. Super confused getting everything wrong and always vanishing.    I would say it was Hillstone level quality/food, I would have expected more creativity from the James Beard award winning chef John Doherty.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St

From the moment we stepped foot into the restaurant last Sunday, we were struck by its inviting, yet refined atmosphere. The rustic decor and warm lighting created a very casual but unique and welcoming atmosphere. The mood was only heightened by the live music and band which performed flawlessly.    The food even more impressive. The Sunday brunch menu offered a great variety of options, from classic breakfast dishes to unique creations that satisfied all our taste buds. The selection of ingredients used in each dish was top-notch and reflected the restaurant's commitment to quality and authenticity as a Farm to Table restaurant, which is not always the case.    The service is unmatched. They made us feel very welcomed, were extremely knowledgeable and made great recommendations.    Overall, absolutely the best meal and experience we had in NYC in a while, and will definitely be back again!",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St

The waitress super polite, but definitely not a 4.4 restaurant. The excuse was that they made the burger on a grill… well or the grill was never cleaned or they dont know how a burger must be cooked. Disgusting!",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14545,18,39,American,4,12/20/2022,"Food and service were excellent. I got the mushroom toast, the butternut squash and kale salad, and the bread pudding for desert. I wish the cocktail menu was a little more diverse in options. If you want a quiet place this is not for you. The front part is quieter than the back half.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St

My favorite thing about this place is it's ambiance: lots of solid wood, high ceilings and plenty of natural light in the bar area.    Today the service was slow and distracted.

Coming from Melbourne Australia, we were bit overwhelmed with the NYC and it was not easy to find place where we would feel comfortable. Following friends recommendation, we came to Black Barn. From the moment we came in, we got special attention from the manager named Zoran who made us feel more than welcome and finally at the right place. Looking through the menu, we were not quite sure what to take but Zoran took time and walked us through the menu and gave us his recommendation. At first we were bit skeptical, but his friendly and genuine smile convinced us to go with it. The food was phenomenal! I didn't even know that I love shrimp tacos!  We absolutely loved every aspect of the experience: the food the atmosphere and especially human touch of that fine manager that made our day! Thanks so much for that and hope to see you soon again!

We started off by getting the party in a pear tree and the northern lights cocktails which gave me and excellent buzz :~)! Then christian sold us on tomahawk steak for two which was a bit of a splurge but definitely worth it. It was DELICIOSO! We also got a side of roasted brussels which was an admiral supporting act.

14563,38,39,American,3,05/20/2019,"Great ambiance, great service, great cocktails, but the food was just okay. The best part of the food was the complimentary bread course with a delicious buttery, garlic infused oil. The cauliflower steak was huge and not sliced like a steak so it didn’t have all the flavor I’d prefer. The gnocchi side dish was over-cooked and bland. The mussels and octopus were very good and my fish for two main course was also very good. Overall a fun night with a few misses.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St

14566,41,39,American,3,05/20/2018,This was my first time here and I would say this place is just okay.  I had the cauliflower and it was seasoned okay.  The salad had a yogurt dressing which was bland and the coffee was a bitter dark roast.  The dessert selection was okay (red velvet was missing more cocoa and the crepes tasted fabricated).  Other than that the service was not that great (we had to ask for the other parts of the meal - didn’t get the OJ and corn muffins because it was too late by the time we asked for it - the server  didn’t mention it) but ambiance was great (live music)!,BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St

There is a great selection of wine and can satisfy the most discerning vinter. I had the ribs and the preparation was well executed. All of the food was prepared perfectly and was delicious.    It is not inexpensive but worth the visit and is a memorable experience. The atmosphere is roomy which is uncommon for the city and a welcomed change.  The decor is rustic modern as very comfortable.

Try the avocado toast with the poached egg for something light or the sweet potato pancakes with bacon and nuts. The hamburger with egg and shredded pork is filling and comes with tasty French fries crusted with crated cheese. There was live music in the front which you can see in my photos. The sound level, despite the crowd,  was reasonable. The service is excellent. It's worth going to for the experience.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St

The place looked crazy busy, but Zoran, the manager, conjured up a table for the 3 of us! Thanks to him!  Also, we were lucky the waitress Julia took care of us. Smooth and friendly service! I loved my smoked salmon and shrimp with grits.  Though the place was crowded, it felt like a friendly place. Zoran was so nice as to check on us a couple of times.  I also worked in decent restaurants like Cipriani and Jean George myself, so I know what it costs to keep the things together with a friendly attitude and smile on such a day. Good job!

14574,49,39,American,1,01/19/2023,"I celebrated my 40th birthday with a group of friends and reserved The Chef's Table. The worst decision of my life was making reservations here. First, for the price of such an exclusive table, the chef never introduced himself to myself - the main patron - nor the table. Secondly, none of the dishes were announced; the waiters rushed each plate while serving us: cold rack of lamb, dry BBQ ribs and flavorless pizza. Not to mention several other dishes that were subpar at best. The waiters would mumble to us then retreat back into the kitchen. My party planner was charged an enormous erroneous fee because apparently Blackbarn thinks black, professional patrons are ""loud and unruly"". She was falsely charged for absolutely nothing. We were a table comprised of CFOs, SVPs of major firms and city officials - why would we conduct ourselves as ""loud and unruly""?! Thankfully, after speaking with one of the managers the following week, she was reimbursed. But not before him telling us that his waitress - a black female that was the only saving grace that night - was poorly tipped. Um, why is the most expensive reservation not kicking back it's fees to the main waitress' overall final tip? And why is their poor business model for their staff the problem of the guests - who left more than 20%?? I would advise NO ONE RESERVE THE CHEF TABLE. Not worth the money, aggravation, nor grief.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St

For events, the upstairs space seats a max of 100 people and has a dedicated bar.  The staff are great, highly professional and courteous.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St

Started out with the drink walking through the forest with hibiscus gin it was delicious and refreshing.    Must haves of the night: the fig pizza was delicious, also the duck breast and sausage sounded quite strange on the menu however it was prepared perfectly. Very tender and well seasoned. The Seabass my mother had and it was honestly very good as well. Bread basket was top tier as well as the rum butterscotch bread pudding a perfect way to end the night    Good but not needed: the tuna tartare was very good just a bit average to what u can find else where same with the shishito peppers. The butternut squash ravioli was good as well however it's very filling and wasn't a stand out of the night.    Could live without: the only thing I personally didn't like was the chicken wings. I got them for my sister who loved them however I wasn't that impressed. It was a bit too Smokey and tasted almost charred.    All in all this place was very good and I would love to dine back here. 9/10 overall",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St

One of the hosts was sneezing in her hands and proceeded to give guests a menu with our cleaning them. That is very unsanitary and should not be behavior done by hosts.    I saw another host wearing a mask and she tried to maintain cleanliness standards, kudos to her, but the others are just coughing and sneezing into the air as if they don’t realize they work in a restaurant.    Not only that, as a host if your coughing, are masks near by? Hand sanitizer? Also, the male host when my husband and I came and dined was absolutely rude, and proceeded to give us a menu that fell to the floor? Again the cleanliness understanding by these hosts seems to be none.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St

14599,76,39,American,4,05/20/2018,"Bit surprised how big the restaurant was as it has both a front and back part. The front has an area for a live band and the back has an open kitchen, which is where we sat. There's also an outside area to eat at too.    We started off with donuts, because - donuts! But they looked a lot better than they tasted and were rather small too considering how much they cost. Just go to Donut Pub.    For our mains we had the croque madame waffle and the reuben sandwich. Both were good. As usual, the waffle was soft, but I think I'll have to accept that it's just the way Americans like their waffles, I prefer the crisp Belgian waffles with soft interior. The meat in the reuben was decent, not as good as Arties (before it closed) but still tasty.    Noise wasn't too bad and service was fine.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14600,77,39,American,5,05/19/2022,Blackbarn has reopened and it’s as delicious as ever. We hd the pork shank and the striped bass. And the cocktail with hibiscus and ginger in it,BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14601,78,39,American,1,11/20/2022,I had a reservation for brunch for 2 and it was not honored. The host told us the manager said we had to wait for a table because they had to close their back room for a party and no two tops were available despite several 4 tops being available they didn’t honor the reservation. And it seems they could have cared less when we left. They should not have accepted our reservation if they couldn’t honor it.,BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14602,79,39,American,5,05/19/2020,"OMG.  Can I just have a standing brunch appointment every Saturday for the rest of my life!  The food, people and ambiance is phenomenal.  Shrimp and grits sent me to heaven.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14603,80,39,American,2,05/20/2018,"Had a reservation for my wife's birthday at 8 pm. They didn't seat us until 8:45 pm. They did give us complimentary french fries for our wait. However, the food was mediocre at best. The fries were over salted and limp. Fries should be crisp. We had two appetizers: the marrow bone which was excellent and the brussel sprouts that were so over cooked and mushy that we couldn't eat them. My cucumber salad was super bland. Basically cut up with a tiny bit of olive oil on top. The main courses were only ok. In NYC where there are so many excellent restaurants to choose from, I would go elsewhere, especially at this price.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14604,81,39,American,5,11/20/2022,Yesterday we had a great dinner with my friends here. We really enjoyed it the food was great.  Our waitress Ellen did a great job she is very fun and professional. Coming back for sure.,BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14605,82,39,American,3,01/19/2023,Mediocre and overpriced. Burger was overcooked and dry/bland - the bun completely fell apart and the bacon was mostly fat and rubbery. Fries were cold. Seems to stay in business due to the number of companies who have offices in rhe area.,BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14606,83,39,American,4,11/20/2022,Food was very good. Get the ribs. Although the shoe strings are just too damn small. Half are gonna end up on the floor. Service was okay but the vibe was just awkward.,BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St

14608,85,39,American,5,11/20/2022,Black Barn is one of my favorite restaurants in the area. I fell in love with their burger and it’s really hard not to order it every single time. The staff is really sweet and thoughtful.  Ellen my server always goes above and beyond,BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St

14610,87,39,American,5,05/20/2019,"Love the layout of this restaurant , spacious but at the same time cozy and inviting.  Food was great and so was the service.  I was there on a weeknight so not sure how it is on a Friday or weekend. I'm sure the atmosphere changes completely. I have also visited the one in Chelsea Market...love it as well very different layout but nice.  You can shop at the Chealsea Market location within the Blackbarn restaurant.  The picture is an area picture.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14611,88,39,American,1,05/19/2020,"Food was very mediocre. Service and first impression was terrible. Had a reservation and the hostesses up front were very flustered and it wasn’t even busy. Our waiter also seemed very robotic. I ordered the NY strip steak & prawn and the quality of the steak was not great. One redeeming quality was the architecture and ambiance. However, overall disappointed because I heard great things about Blackbarn, but ultimately wasn’t happy with it. Won’t go back.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St

14616,94,39,American,4,09/21/2022,Great food and nice atmosphere. The octopus and scallops are worth trying! I did see a few tomahawk steaks come out and they looked impressive and tasty. Great presentation.,BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14617,95,39,American,5,05/19/2022,This place is IT! Not only did it have such a cool ambiance but the food blew me away. (5/16)Monday night we had a show piece experience when the steak was delivered to the table by the back server with such a warm smile when he presented; it was an expectation unmatched by no other.  I’ve never seen a presentation like that by the wait staff.  We had ordered the tomahawk for 2 and holy cow(literally)!!! Temperature was to perfection and definitely recommend it to anyone who comes here. Service  Food Presentation Experience  Will be going back within the next month because of how much we loved it :),BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St

14620,98,39,American,1,11/20/2022,The worst service ever! I never had such an experience in NYC.  We wait 1.5 h for our food and it never came. They gave us excuse that to prepare the ravioli takes more time!!! And of coarse we left. It was offensive,BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St

14624,103,39,American,2,05/19/2022,"Atmosphere of restaurant is very nice, we sat outdoors. Food was okay but the real issue is the service. Once our food arrived, we never saw our server again. We would have ordered more food and drinks but after 45 minutes decided to ask for the check.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14625,104,39,American,3,05/19/2022,The service was great. Ordered the shrimp and grits and it wasn’t a good choice. The shrimp tasted boiled and flavorless. The grits also lacked any flavor. My friends did enjoy their meals. Just stay away from the shrimp and grits and you’ll be ok. Atmosphere was great. The live jazz band was very good.,BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14626,106,39,American,5,05/19/2022,Beautiful brunch on Saturday. Espresso martinis and Bellinis were delicious. The string band in the front room was a lovely touch (may be worth requesting seating up front upon reservation as the vibe was beautiful but a bit lost when seated in the back dining room). Our server was wonderful and made excellent recommendations. Our group of 6 all tried something different including three of the starters and all enjoyed every bite. Can’t go wrong xo,BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14627,107,39,American,3,11/20/2022,Food was amazing.  Staff was just sort of phoning it in.  They couldn't get a dirty martini right.  Meh?,BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14628,108,39,American,5,06/23/2022,"Came in last week for happy hour. Had a little trouble opening the front door, but the manager politely pushed the door open, inviting us in. What a nice touch :)  We were then welcomed by Juan (maybe the bar supervisor) with 2 glasses of water as soon as we sat at bar. We wanted something not on menu. Juan crafted some old fashion drinks for us, his way.  Probably the best that I’ve had in NYC! He was cleaning the bar behind the scenes, which is so important in these times. He also provided some direction to a fellow colleague on bar set. It was very impressive.  Juan is a keeper!  Can’t wait to return when my travels take me back to the big Apple!",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14629,109,39,American,5,05/19/2022,Excellent food.  I agree that the appetizer portions are small and that you should plan to order a few if you're in a group.  The bread pudding was phenomenal!,BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St

There was a problem with the credit card system that was completely out of their hands, but their team handled the issue effortlessly. The workers were very polite with all the customers and made sure everyone was still having a good time. I believe it was the manager Lia who talked us through the process. Even though the restaurant was facing difficulties, it was overall one of the best experience I have had. Overall, it was a 11/10.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St

I went there last Friday night, Friday the thirteenth, with my girlfriend and she absolutely adored it, mind you she is very picky. The staff was excellent and the food was great. We’ve been here before, pre covid times, and while I enjoyed it nothing comparable to this time around. Service was phenomenal and I can definitely notice an improvement from when I was here last. Great job to the staff at black barn! I will definitely recommend it to others!",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14636,116,39,American,3,05/19/2022,"I will start by saying,  I am aware it was a holiday, but it was just not great. We had made reservations weeks and weeks ago for a special thanksgiving dinner . We arrived on time, just a short wait by 2 very nice young ladies at the reception  area. We were not happy with our table because it sat right in front of the kitchen swinging door, it was to close to the doors and it was busy in and out, this is the worst table in the place. We kindly asked if we can be moved, the waitress said to ask up at the reception area. When I went to the desk there was a different lady there this time, wearing a green dress, the manager. I kindly requested a new table and added that I had made this reservation weeks ago,  she immediately snapped at me "" well so did lots of people"" she was rude and impolite, plain and simple. There were quite a few empty tables available,  I said nothing else , just trying to avoid this unpleasant person on thanksgiving. We were seated at a new table that was just fine, the wait staff was amazing and friendly, the holiday food was just ok, the turkey was moist and good, the sides arrived cold, the desert was great. I understand the food being a bit off because of the holiday, but I don't excuse the rude manager. I took the high road.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14637,117,39,American,3,05/19/2022,Had drinks with a friend at bar. Seemed like the bartender couldn’t be bothered. Not that it was crazy busy. He just hardly seemed to care. Poor experience on that front. Can’t comment on food. Ambiance was pretty good. Minus lackluster service.,BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14638,118,39,American,1,05/19/2022,"No one in this restaurant has a clue. Took 20 minutes to get seated for a reservation we were on time for, slowest service for a half empty restaurant, and the most uncomfortable restaurant manager who stares at you every bite you take. The food was subpar for the price and the menu was unhelpful for not listing sides or what fully accompanied a dish. Ewa our server was never to be found and when we did try to pay the manger set her phone down at our table without saying a word to us. It took 25 minutes from asking for our check to actually receiving the check. Also don’t call it a jazz brunch if the music is only played in 1/4 of the restaurant.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St

14644,125,39,American,5,05/19/2020,"Enjoyed a brunch here the food and service both really good. Atmosphere was fine, a bit on the dark side for my preference...I like to see what I’m eating. For us, the portions were on the smaller than average for those prices. We know this because usually a main will suffice, but here 2 courses were needed to feel content. Nice to come for a special occasion perhaps.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14645,127,39,American,5,05/20/2018,"Awesome, awesome spot. Came here with my mom and best friend and we had an amazing time. We all ordered different things and then shared. Not one dish disappointed.  The butternut squash ravioli was delicious, as was the wild boar ravioli.  The scallops were perfectly cooked and wonderfully savory, and the octopus was tender with a nice delicate flavor. Overall fantastic.  And don’t let the front room fool you - the back half of the restaurant is much cozier, with tablecloths and a fun, barn-meets-industrial vibe. Our waitress was also lovely and friendly, and incredibly patient with us.  Truly a wonderful evening.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14646,128,39,American,5,05/19/2022,"Exquite and refined a venerable feast for the senses. It was like being at every ski lodge but with an urban flair.  I think if they had a fireplace we would have never left.  From the sommelier to our waitress and the support staff we were treated like VIP which we are.  In addition we left another restaurant a favorite of ours in Kips Bay wanted to shove us in a two person table in the worst location after explaining that the refined booths were taken for an hour and a half later.  We were seated in a 4 person booth table at Black Barn with great views of everything including Chef John’s careful culinary experience and attention to every detail:  My beef shank was the best meal I have ever had the pleasure of within my world wide gourmand experiences in the worlds very best restaurants.  Also the bread pudding was delicious but also well represented.  It’s difficult to achieve style without pretension, Homey and cozy without tack decoration.  I’m sad to be so positive I mean I expect to be turned away because their so packed.  I am very ruthless when it comes to a bit of a 4 dollar rated place, but I tipped the staff 30 percent and would have delighted to dine at double the price.  Oscar Wilde said, one should eat well and live well Black Barn is culture for beginners.  About the photo, Chef John on left yours truly Terry on the right",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St

From the seating to the lighting to the flatware, everything was top notch. I have the lamb, highly recommend that dish. Cooked perfectly, vegetables were very fresh and the plating was unique. Definitely am going to return with my girlfriend.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14650,132,39,American,4,05/19/2022,Delicious contemporary American dishes. Very spacious dining rooms with industrial / farmhouse designs.    The only downside is that the serving staff is a bit slow. (Might be due to Covid.),BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St

14657,141,39,American,4,05/19/2022,"Nice decor, good service. Pancakes and chilaquiles were very good. However, we got the shrimp and grits to share and it was so oily I could hardly eat it.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14658,142,39,American,5,05/20/2019,"The food was really really good. I had the chicken Milanese sandwich and octopus as my appetizer. The octopus was great, nicely charred and grilled to perfection. The chicken Milanese was amazing with some really good sauce and tender chicken. The food and ordering process took a while as the staff didn't come to our table very frequently, so definitely plan on lunch taking at least an hour!",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14659,143,39,American,1,05/19/2022,A resounding disappointment. The food is objectively overpriced and underwhelming. But the service - the service is what gets you. Expect tremendously long waits for you to be served or for anything you order to arrive at your table. You’ll also be greeted with the most nonsensical rules where you can only order certain menu items depending upon where you sit … in the same restaurant. Truly a foolish operation that I hope meets its destiny - closing shop.,BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14660,144,39,American,5,05/20/2019,"First visit for our party of six, with a reservation. We opted to order almost everything on the menu and shared, along with a bottle of wine.

Chocolate souffle for dessert.  Highly recommended.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14661,145,39,American,5,05/20/2018,"The food here was DELICIOUS. I felt like the portions were quite small for the price but the taste and quality made up for it. The atmosphere is really nice, with live music in the front and a huge dining room in the back. The waiter was super nice as well and gave us some free corn bread on the house. Would go back again :).",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14662,146,39,American,5,05/20/2018,Everything we ordered here was amazing. I had the scallops as my main meal and the gnocchi. Both so good. I really liked the rustic decor and coat check.

Not sure if it was an off day, but it took almost 20 minutes to seat our party of 7, then another 20 minutes for the waiter to visit our table. All the dishes were a little on the spicy side (but definitely yummy if you don't mind the spice). Still giving this place 4 stars because my first experience was great.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14666,150,39,American,5,05/20/2018,"Cuisine was exquisite. Wine and dinner menu were incredibly satisfying. Our party of four enjoyed a family style dinner, accommodated by the exceptional service, and everything was perfect, every item on the plate deliciously seasoned and carefully situated, all of which heightened the experience. Better still was the ambiance; once you step inside this restaurant, it immediately instills a feeling as if you've just stepped into a while other world, helping you to forget that you're eating dinner in the largest, most vibrant and bustling city on the planet. I would highly recommend it, the experience was flawless, and I'm anxious to visit again.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St

14668,152,39,American,5,05/20/2017,"This chic restaurant north of Madison Square mid-block is  a quite reprieve. You walk into a dark comforting interior with soft lighting and music feels modern yet traditional flair. The seating area is vast with an open kitchen to the side. The menu is as eclectic and everything looks delicious just reading the menu. We also appreciate that it has round tables for large groups. Square tables are so difficult to talk but surely easier for restaurants.    We had a fabulous time for the evening celebrating two birthdays. I'll have to say it was hard to choose from the menu but we decided to share some and a main per our server's suggestions. The food was exceptionally good. I honestly can't gripe on anything other than I wish there was more. Our water was always filled. Servers always attentive when needed and everyone was exceptionally gracious. We were even surprised with a table visit from head chef John Doherty to see how we liked the food, birthday wishes and complimentary desserts. I think those little touches really impressed us.    Black Barn is sophisticated without the attitude. It is about the food and service from the evening we went. We definitely look forward to coming back again. I don't hand out 5 stars easily but I'll have to Black Barn rightly earned it.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St

14670,154,39,American,5,05/20/2018,"This place has an absolutely amazing brunch. They have these amazing honey buns that are you have to avoid eating too many of. Otherwise, their french toast is easily one of the best I've had in NYC and they have a great Salmon tartine.    Also a really large space so relatively easy to get reservations. Cool decor and live music on weekends!    I just can't believe that I haven't been here for dinner yet...but I have friends that speak very highly of it.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14671,155,39,American,5,05/20/2018,"Great ambiance - feels fancy but also rustic and comfortable instead of stuffy. We were a large party so shared a bit of everything...seafood platter, charcuterie board, white pizza, mushroom toast, cauliflower steak. We all loved all of it, couldn't complain about anything. The wait staff was amazing and added to our experience.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14672,156,39,American,2,09/21/2022,"Average service, upscale food but too salty and obviously not hitting the mark they set for themselves. Disappointed when you see prices and the final bill.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14673,157,39,American,5,05/19/2022,Delicious! Loved the complimentary cornbread. My croque madame was out of this world. The Bloody Mary was smoky and very unique.,BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14674,158,39,American,5,05/20/2019,"If you’re in NYC, you HAVE to come here. The service is excellent, and the food is full of flavor. We made a reservation here for brunch, we ordered the breakfast burrito and the captain crunch crusted French toast- both were so full of flavor and delicious. The portions are huge! This place is worth the money you pay- and the little corn muffins they bring out before the meal, oh gosh, SO good! The interior is so modern, just like you’re in a fancy barn. I would highly recommend this restaurant.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14675,159,39,American,1,05/19/2020,Our group was seated and we did not have a server greet us for 45 minutes. We placed our drink order and did not get our bottomless Bloody Mary’s for another 25 minutes. The build your own Bloody Mary station was not re-stocked. The table was missing utensils and a few of the ones that were given were dirty. The management didn’t put forth any effort in apologizing for the lack of service. Food was good and came out quickly. Another highlight of the experience was that our water was refilled often. Not sure if they were understaffed for the day but overall poor service.,BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14676,160,39,American,5,05/20/2019,"Phenomenal dining experience in every way. Service throughout our meal was incredible and the hospitable atmosphere made the experience very approachable despite being an upscale restaurant.    Received a delicious complementary appetizer soon after we sat down as well as bread for the table done three ways! Our entrees were delicious (highly recommend the ravioli and the duck lasagna) and even though we were full, we couldn't resist dessert, which was a hit.    Overall, would recommend BlackBarn because the atmosphere and service is as good as the food -- something that is not the case every where in the city.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14677,161,39,American,4,05/20/2019,"Really loved the entrees and the dessert here and the ambiance was fantastic!    I came here Saturday after looking at quite a few different restaurants. I was really excited when my sister was able to snag a reservation.    From the outside, this place doesn't look very big. I was actually quite surprised at how gigantic this place is. The decor is just like being in a barn but with no animals and hay on the ground.    The appetizers here were pretty lackluster and I thought the pizza could use a lot of work. The amuse bouche was mediocre.    However, the entrees themselves were fantastic -- I ordered the Amish chicken and it came with celery ravioli that was to die for. My sister ordered the BBQ ribs and they were cooked perfectly. My brother-in-law ordered the scallops and devoured them.    The side dishes were phenomenal. Highly recommend the gnocchi and the brussels sprouts.    For dessert, get the apple cider donuts! We ordered them and they were fluffy and delicious. Honestly some of the best doughnuts I've ever had because they weren't too doughy. The caramel sauce was the perfect accompaniment with them.    Service was largely a miss and we got ignored for part of the meal which is why I probably wouldn't give this place five stars but their food is great and the vibe can't be beat.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14678,162,39,American,4,05/19/2020,"Attentive without interrupting service - coffee & water never empty. The Paloma pitcher was well priced & delicious. Other items were a little overpriced. The French toast crumbles on top were great, but the bread was a little less fluffy than I prefer. The bacon, egg, & cheese sandwich was good, but again, a little overpriced.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14679,163,39,American,3,05/20/2018,"Food was good but... Service was more akin to a casual chain restaurant. Entrees came out before we had silverware to eat it with. That's pretty poor, especially at this price point and especially when you tell me you can't put in our appetizer order until you get our entire order. That's for fine dining restaurants with much better attention to detail.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St

The host saw it but just ignored and did not say anything. A huge turn off.    We ordered the cauliflower steak, a lot of dressing soaked the side salad and the cauliflower, it is ok, but nothing near exceptional. we also ordered the Korean ribs, it was pretty dry, not juicy at all. When we ordered the second bottle of wine, the one we picked was not available, we were given two options, but the one we picked instead was $20 more expensive, but we were not informed about the price difference. It was not even busy, but the busboys kept coming over and ask us if we were done and if he could take our plates. Overall, was not a great experience. It is overrated.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St

Juan the bartender was extremely pleasant and helpful in helping us choose are drinks for the evening.  The chef's table dinner was a delicious 5 course experience.  The Rabbit remoulade ( not sure if that was the name of that course) was absolutely exquisite!!! I begged the chef to please but it on the regular menu!! For my first visit, I totally enjoyed my experience and look forward to going back soon especially in light of the fact that the chef's table menu changes periodically.  Would definitely recommend this place.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14686,171,39,American,5,05/19/2020,"There is so much I can offer that made my experience at Blackbarn incredibly memorable! Let's start with the design. As an architect, I loved the attention to detail in the interior building, especially the barn atmosphere created with the trusses and doors. The wait staff was attentive without being overbearing and we're extremely knowledgeable about the products and food offered. Finally, the food was a creative affair that entertained my taste buds throughout our meal. I especially loved the watermelon salad!",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St

14688,173,39,American,5,05/20/2019,"Amazing service from Caroline and the entire team.  Caroline was exceptionally friendly, helpful and attentive and the food was delicious at brunch.  It was so worth the luxurious visit.  Looking forward to my next visit.  The only negative was the lack of help from Darren to provide an earlier table/reservation when I called.  Luckily I was able to adjust my reservation myself and got to enjoy the brunch earlier.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14689,174,39,American,4,05/20/2019,Good spot for happy hour! Good location. It was a little more chilled out than the dinner hour because we got there early so we could hear ourselves.

Desserts were good but super sweet.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14692,177,39,American,3,05/20/2016,"Poor.  This is my second visit to the restaurant.  First visit was over brunch with my husband and tonight with a friend and colleague. I work and live in the area and feel disappointed to had been treated so poorly tonight.  I Just finished having dinner. I had the oxtail with mashed potatoes.  It was OK.  But what I found most annoying was feeling rushed all around, first to order and then to pay the bill as quickly as it was possible.  The waiter kept coming back to get the bill and credit card. It felt quite uncomfortable since I was the one who recommend this placed to my friend whom I had not seen for a while,  We felt   quite rushed.  Not nice.  The waiter did not have the finesse to get the message that the best way to have people like your place is by being attentive to people's needs.  This is very different than SD-26.  My suggestion is to be less intense and allow people to enjoy the place, particularly when there were many tables unoccupied.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St

Would recommend when in the neighbourhood.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14694,179,39,American,3,05/20/2019,"Food was good. Decor is great. But it takes soooooo long for the food to be served. We spent a good 3 hrs there even though we ordered apps and entrees at the beginning itself. If that's the kind of evening you're looking for, relaxed and in no rush at all, then it's a good place to go. A little expensive but for this ambience in NYC I guess that's normal. Expect about $200 for group of 3.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14695,180,39,American,2,05/19/2020,"Ok food, subpar experience. We were greeted by the gracious host and seated in the Tavern section for the evening with the option to order from either menu, which was convenient. While I will note that many of the dishes has nice ingredients, the configurations were off. The kale salad had entirely too much butternut squash and was overly sweet. If that aspect were omitted, the salad would have been impeccable. I also felt that the bone marrow had too many breadcrumbs (over 50%) which gave it a weird consistency. The sirloin steak was also tough, which should not have been the case with a supposed premium cut. While I understand it wasn’t filet mignon, it was more labor intensive than it should have been. To top it off, the service was extremely lacking with empty glasses more than half of the time and having to flag the server down for most of our meal for basic things. I even had to grab the dessert menu from the host stand because he was nowhere to be found and we didn’t have all night.  All in all, the experience was borderline ok for what it was. However, with a premium price tag for an experience that missed the mark, it doesn’t warrant a return. With so many options,  I wouldn’t quite recommend.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14696,181,39,American,5,05/20/2016,"What a Wonderful Experience!  The Tasting Menu was extraordinary.  Chef John has a gift for magnificent combinations of tastes and textures.  Be sure to order a Cauliflower Steak (yes, that's what it is)  Each and every dish is memorable.    The front room only gives a Hint of the Huge Back Room  This restaurant is a HIDDEN GEM!

14697,182,39,American,1,05/20/2017,"We were a party of 5 and at the end of dining, the overwhelming consensus was that we had a terrible experience.  I’ve listed the key points below:  4 of us arrived at 730pm with 1 running about 5-10 minutes behind. We were told abruptly we were unable to be seated at our table until the 5th person arrived, and were told to seat and wait at the bar. This was quite awkward as there was no room at the bar and the only space was right at the front so we all had to stand awkwardly by the front door waiting for we don’t know what. We should have been seated and happy to have drinks at the table with the 5th person arriving soon after.  On to the meals, the menu was exciting but all the dishes we tried were lacklustre and very substandard, particularly for the standard expected of Black Barn.  Bone Marrow- the portion was extremely small and there were hardly any if any clams in the dish.  Lobster Salad- the lobster was chewy and full of butane gas flavour which was disgusting  Pork Shank -  meat was stringy and tough and not seasoned, the accompanying greens were so bitter that were inedible.  Service was not great with our water glasses constantly being empty.    I praise the decor and interior design of Black Barn but sadly this was the only positive in our experience.    I have travelled the world and have dined at many restaurants of all cuisines and all price levels but unfortunately this experience sits at the bottom of my list. It is unfortunate as Black Barn had been one of the restaurants we were looking forward to on our trip to New York. I have no problem paying any price for food but I need quality and I need value. I feel the cheffing team need to taste their own food and re-assess their skills, technique and also have a look at the quality of produce they are buying in.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St

14701,186,39,American,1,05/20/2018,"Pleasant experience, until the end that is. The waitress had made a simple mistake. She admitted her mistake. No big deal. However, the manager insisted on making us pay for the mistake. Our waitress ended up covering the extra cost herself, which the manager came by to rub in our faces as if it was our fault. Look, I’ve worked for great managers and terrible ones, but I’ve never seen one treat any customer this way. When bad experience happen at restaurants, I tend to toss it up to someone having a bad day. You never know what’s going on behind the scenes. I get that. But it is not okay to treat anyone (much less your customer) this way. With some many great places to eat and drink in New York, I will never come back here.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14702,187,39,American,5,05/20/2016,"Black Barn is an upscale barn bar, lounge, restaurant with spacious digs like The Tavern, The Dining Hall and additional private rooms. The decor is new and warm, dark and cozy, with a fancier setting in the main dining area. The food is well thought out, delightful and very homey, but still Manhattan and trendy. Get the fries that come with sour cream dipping sauce, the mushroom toast and the ice cream sandwich for desert. They serve wine as well as beer and have very attentive and friendly staff. Definitely go for the mushroom toast and the ice cream sandwich desert; both will blow your mind!",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St

Buzzing around the reclaimed wooden barn is a jean-clad service staff with exceptional knowledge of the menu and chef's specialties. Overly accommodating to allergy concerns our server could list nearly every ingredient in each dish, allowing for seamless ordering and substitutions. Braised short rib was the house specialty and was exceptional;the roasted cauliflower is also a must-have, even as a shared main course side.

The food is great! And I didnt even go for lunch or dinner yet. Their brunch is outstanding! The chicken and waffles is unlike and Chicken and Waffle I've ever had. Lighter than the usual huge portion of chicken and the side of kale salad is genius. The only kale salad I ever ate . And the Waffle Croque Madame is so delicious. Incredibly savory and delicious.,BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St
14707,192,39,American,4,05/20/2019,"Serving new American food in a modern, rustic chic, BLACKBARN is well worth visiting. The atmosphere is relaxed with no music, thick wooden tables, and modern leather chairs. It's dark and a bit romantic. While a bit pricey, BLACKBARN is well worth it. Boasting a decent craft beer selection and a delicious array of cocktails (which frequently are jalapeno based and err on the spicy side), the drinks are great. The food is definitely the highlight though. The bone marrow appetizer was a clear star, incorporating manila clams and a nice crunchy, crumbly crust and a lemon zest, unlike any other bone marrow I've had before. For mains, I had the lamb shank, which was cooked perfectly and featured a delicious assortment of sides, grilled diced onions and a single large raviolo of lamb shoulder over a bed of greens. A perfect, varied and delightful dish. My guest got the butternut squash ravioli, which was a delightful combination of sweet, salty, and savory thanks to the lardon accompaniment. For desserts, we had the toffee bread pudding and matcha mousse, and the mousse clearly shined above with a balance of bitter, crunchy, sweet, and cakey. It's a bit pricey, but not out of range for the quality we got. Would highly recommend to anyone.",BLACKBARN Restaurant,19 E 26th St

We arrived and it was practically empty and stayed pretty much empty for the 2 hours we were there. So, that was odd.    The food was very tasty and seasoned. Octopus appetizer was yummy. Chicken Milanese sandwich yummy. Donut was good. The 4 stars are mainly for the food.    The server was meh. She didn't make eye contact. Didn't ask if we needed sugar for our tea. We saw her chatting it up at another table so I wondered if it was a racial bias thing (conscious or not) or she just didn't like our table or what. It was weird.

14714,199,39,American,3,05/20/2018,"Mixed feeling about this place. First off, we had a reservation and were stuck in the tunnel so we called and the hostess was quite curt and abrasive. Second, This restaurant used to be SD26, seems like they changed the decor but the feng shui is weird. The overall decor is all black and makes it feel  Weird to be honest. The food was ok, my lamb was good but came out warmish to cold - would have been better served hot. As far as the service goes, they certainly tried hard but again came off awkward - and couldn’t figure out how to split the check so we had to manually do ourselves.    It was ok.

Let the hostess know that nobody had come to take our order and that our seats were open again - she offered to sit us in another area.

But as a person who worked in the food industry and a minority I know how hard it’s to be working. But I had my reason for not tipping and it was unacceptable to make me look as I was not part of this white type of looking bar I was one of the only people, plus my group of color.

46986,90,185,American,1,05/27/2017,"Not sure where the people who gave this place more than 1 star ate, but sure wasn't here at Land and Sea Diner. This place is dreadful. Wife ordered a BLT on lightly toasted white. What came was a sandwich on very toasted bread that was literally burnt black on the inside. It had nasty romaine lettuce, the outer leaves that you normally tear off and toss with 4 slices of pale pink, unrippened tomato. My son got the crabcakes over linguini.  Crab cakes is what was listed but they are actually fake crabmeat  (sea legs) that looked like it was put through a ricer and made into a patty covered with a tasteless thick coating that we think was cornmeal. The sauce on the pasta was watery, tasteless and seemed to be a mix of a few chopped unripe tomatoes, ketchup and water.  I got a cheeseburger, it was awesome, huge and one of the best I have had.  Enjoyed it immensely.  The pickle spears we very good too. The small cups of cole slaw that came with sandwiches - disgusting.  A weird musty taste.  I agree with other reviewer, wanted to give less than 1 star but no option for it.",Land & Sea Restaurant,20-12 Fair Lawn Ave
24946,0,78,American,5,06/23/2022,"So incredibly good! In Morristown for business, my team member and I stopped here for dinner and drinks. She has the Steelhead, and I grabbed two small plates: the gnocchi and the crab cake. Both were excellent! Crab cake was one of the best I've ever had, so lightly breaded and fried to a delicate crunch. Mm.    We each grabbed a drink (which was fine... but didn't meet the quality of the food) and a dessert. I had the strawberry semi-frieddo and she had the carrot torte. Highly recommend - everything was delicious and I'd definitely come back.",Blue Morel Restaurant and Wine Bar,2 Whippany Rd

24948,2,78,American,4,01/19/2023,"We were a table of nine on Christmas Eve, obviously a busy night. Despite a couple of hiccups in service, restaurant manager Devin Reed was gracious and very accommodating to ensure everything was right, without prompting or request from us.  He truly understands proper hospitality.    The prix-fixe selections were delicious, with the scallops nicely balanced with the butternut squash.  The beef loin was very good, but the standout of the night was the crab cake. Fantastic, just large lumps of crabmeat held together delicately and just crisped enough.  I would return just for the crab cake.    Beer selection could have been better, but the wine list was extensive.    A very solid choice and conveniently located.  Thank you Mr. Reed for the a smooth experience on an otherwise hectic holiday night. We enjoyed it!",Blue Morel Restaurant and Wine Bar,2 Whippany Rd
24949,3,78,American,1,11/20/2022,What a disappointment.    The bread basket had stale rolls at the bottom suggesting they may not throw out their old food correctly.    Some of the oysters tasted fresh some of them had a fish stench.    The drinks did not hit the spot.  They felt watered down.  Something was off.    The dry aged loin of beef at rare temperature was very tough.  Now that I think of it maybe they cooked it medium-well despite me asking for rare was to hide it might not be fresh.    The dulce de leche was a really dry angel cake.    The sushi was really good but not good enough to excuse the issues with the other food.    Overall it put us in a worse mood than when we had arrived.,Blue Morel Restaurant and Wine Bar,2 Whippany Rd
24950,4,78,American,5,04/19/2023,A hotel restaurant that elevates the norm. Good bar staff and a menu that is sufficiently different to be not just another bar menu.

They accidently gave our entrees to a table that arrived after us so we had to wait a long time after we were done with the apps to get the rest of our order.

24962,16,78,American,5,10/21/2022,"How to describe the quintessential small town breakfast in beautiful Morristown New Jersey. It was a mid fall morning as a crisp breeze awoke us at the Westin. After glaring through the looking glass of our window, my eyes looked upon the sweet rolling landscape of the New Jersey hillside.    Wander down 4 floors to Blue Morel and luxury awaits. Glass double doors splayed open for my arrival greeted me and my guests as we effortlessly walk right to our table. With no hostess abound the casual seat yourself approach is modern and refreshing. Upon requesting a menu our kind and gentle waiter offers the buffet. A bountiful offering which allows for a personalized omakase. The eggs are fluffy and bright, the potatoes smell of rosemary and lavender, the bacon crisped to perfected. The continental section flows with morning pastries seemingly flown in from the French Riviera. Our waiter pours the most beautiful and rich Colombian blended coffee and regales us with its fair trade and organic origins. Just last week little Paco and his family, the farmers behind this beautiful blend graced restaurant staff with their presence.    Blue Morel has my heart, my culinary pallete has forever been satiated from this exquisite offering, only otherwise found at Michelin awarded restaurants.

We had a nice mother's day bruch, it was way over priced considering the extremely over priced bloody Mary's ( that were mostly Ice) cost 22 dollars.... Potatoes on buffet were over cooked and had been sitting for a long time.  Cold asparagus app on buffet was way undercooked.  Omelet bar was great. Oysters were good, but no attention was paid to them so you had to avoid dried out oysters.   If it had been half the cost, it would have been worth it, but 80 dollars per person is WAY over priced.  We had a nice time, may even return cause the food here is good.  I just think the quality was way down for Mother's day.",Blue Morel Restaurant and Wine Bar,2 Whippany Rd

24967,22,78,American,1,06/23/2022,"Absolutely horrible. I was staying at the hotel for a wedding, and I could not be more displeased with the service at the restaurant. The bartender was judgemental, rude and unprofessional. She took one look at myself and my girlfriend, then walked away to continue tending the current patrons, brushing us off as if we weren’t there. (It’s pretty unfortunate because I was eager to try the crab cake, and their B.A.L.T. sandwich.) We even said excuse me, asked for menus, but apparently we didn’t matter. My older mother tried going down shortly after for coffee, as this is supposed to be a full service restaurant, and the bartender once again was rude and disrespectful, telling my mother coffee is only available while the coffee bar is open, albeit it saying it’s available all day in the menu. The bartender nastily went off to look for coffee, but ten minutes later never returned so my mother gave up and left.",Blue Morel Restaurant and Wine Bar,2 Whippany Rd

The octopus salad wasn't my favorite thing. The olives plus capers were a bit much. It certainly wasn't terrible however. But the drinks were delicious.

We were expecting a great meal for the price.    So for the good. The wait staff was great, they were attentive while not being intrusive. The restaurant called to verify the restaurant and asked if anyone had food allergies, my wife does, so that was a nice touch.    No for the not so good. The food was just ok, the food was good, but not worth the price. My wife ordered the beef tenderloin medium rare, it came to the table rare, she ate some of it, but couldn't finish it. When they came to clear the table and asked if everything was alright and if we wanted the beef wrapped we told them how the beef was under cooked. They didn't do or say anything.

The location is inside of the hotel and you literally have to walk into the hotel as if you are checking in and make a left to get into the restaurant. It was very nice, open and well lit. We had reservations for 8 so we hung out and had drinks at the bar. It took a bit longer than I would have liked to be served but we eventually were. The drinks were okay at best. All other drinks were made in from of the guest except for ours, perhaps we ordered something that just happened to be further away at the bar, no big deal. We were seated and when we got the menu it was opposite what he initially picked online. The price fixe menu was the only option and we did not like most of the set options so we politely excused our selves and went elsewhere.

Right out of gate strike one, second strike I ordered a Blanton's neat ""whiskey"" waiter returned to tell me they ran out. Okay not a big deal ordered a different drink. Being NYE they had a fixed menu which was great, very limited menu. Already knew I was getting the one and only steak on the menu. Third strike as I began to order the waiter once again explain to me that they just ran out of that entree. Now I was upset because I wasn't crazy about the other few options I had plus I wanted STEAK.. I'm 100% sure the waiter understood my frustrations and do you think a manager would have come over to apologize?? Nope not even glance. Strike number four I asked the waiter to just give us a house wine as we don't need anything fancy nope again to our dislike $70 bottle was on the bill, my fault I should have asked but their were plenty of bottle in the $40 range.. which is what a house bottle means. The appetizer were pretty good our entrees were okay under seasoned and dissert was just okay. For $352.00 for two it was incredibly disappointing. Have reservations at Cafe Navona this Sat it's always an amazinge meal impeccable service at half the cost.. Lost my business for good...",Blue Morel Restaurant and Wine Bar,2 Whippany Rd
24986,42,78,American,4,05/19/2020,"Great bar, limited and not vegetarian friendly menu. Also redecorated in drab gray.  I liked the blues better. Go last Thursday of the month for free whiskey tastings and live music. And they do interesting wine, beer and liquor dinners with unique menus. Worth every penny.",Blue Morel Restaurant and Wine Bar,2 Whippany Rd
24987,44,78,American,4,05/20/2019,"Very nice hotel restaurant! Had the field greens salad, short rib tortelli and chocolate brioche. The tortelli and brioche were just wonderful! Great flavor in every bite, perfectly cooked and seasoned! But, for a hotel restaurant and portion size, a bit pricey.",Blue Morel Restaurant and Wine Bar,2 Whippany Rd
24988,45,78,American,2,05/20/2018,"Expensive!! I have to mention we went for breakfast not dinner. It was buffet style setup. Grab your own food. We had a big party of people. It was the day after the wedding and a bunch of us wanted to grab breakfast together.    First off the food was mediocre at best. You can get better food from any nearby diner. The check came. They charged us a mandatory gratuity. Normally I would have no problem with that, but it was a buffet. I mean come on. We have to get our own food. The price was outrageous. $60 for breakfast for 2 people. Really overpriced considering the food quality    If you're looking to get breakfast, do yourself a favor and avoid it here.",Blue Morel Restaurant and Wine Bar,2 Whippany Rd
24989,46,78,American,4,05/20/2019,"Food is very good on a consistent basis.  Had the Venison and lamb shank. Venison was slightly under seasoned but cooked perfectly.  Squash on the plate was underdone. Lamb was very good, pear sabayon was a unique treat! Cocktails are always fantastic!",Blue Morel Restaurant and Wine Bar,2 Whippany Rd
24990,47,78,American,5,05/20/2018,Another wonderful meal at the Blue Morel. Everything is so beautifully done here. From drinks at the bar to delicious desserts (if you still have room). Spent some time at the bar to relax a bit before dinner. Try the Blue Morel Manhattan if you love bourbon. The crab cakes and tuna tartar were a great way to start off our meal. The sommelier  helped use choose two great bottles of wine and a fine pick for wine by the glass. The braised lamb shank was new to the menu and was highly recommended by our waiter. Three of use had it and we were not disappointed. The pan roasted branzino was delicious too.  Warm Chocolate Brioche and Red Wine Poached Pear were shared by all to finish off the meal. Service was wonderful.  If you want a dining experience  that is done perfectly then come to the Blue Morel.,Blue Morel Restaurant and Wine Bar,2 Whippany Rd
24991,48,78,American,3,05/19/2020,"The ambience was great. Food was good. Be wary of their online postings. We went for the specific tasting menu that was posted online that day, but were disappointed to find that it had not been kept up to date. The reason was that it changed so often and was tough to keep up with. I would suggest just not posting a menu if it is that much trouble for the staff to stay current.",Blue Morel Restaurant and Wine Bar,2 Whippany Rd
24992,49,78,American,5,05/20/2016,"We've been coming here every so often since the restaurant opened,  and it's reliably great!  The octopus and pork belly appetizer is a must-have, as are the brussel sprouts. Service is always extremely attentive, without being overbearing. This place is not inexpensive if you're to do it well -  add in a drink or two,  apps,  entrees,  and dessert,  and you're amongst the priciest restaurants in town, but you can count on the quality,  and that's not always the case at other ""high-end""  restaurants.",Blue Morel Restaurant and Wine Bar,2 Whippany Rd
24993,50,78,American,4,05/20/2017,"This is an upscale restaurant in the Westin in Morristown NJ. We had a $25 gift certificate from my wife's hair salon, and this was close to a concert we were going to at MPAC, so we gave it a shot. It wasn't very crowded at 6:30pm on a Friday, so we were seated immediately. Service was a little bit slow, but the staff did a good job of making sure we had everything we needed. I'd rather have that than constant nagging and interrupting of conversation. It's very pricey though, as you might expect I guess for up-scale. I had the 10oz filet mignon ($38) and my wife had the duck ($33 I think?). Both came with a small salad on the plate. We had a nice basket of different breads though. Both meals were delicious and cooked properly. I also got the rustic potatoes for $9. Those were great, but the price stuck in my craw a bit. We also had the creme brulee for dessert, it wasn't the best I ever had, but it was good. It had some kind of egg nog flavor to it, stronger than others I've had. It also had a scoop of sherbert on top, which I didn't think really went too well with creme brulee. It was a nice treat for us, we wouldn't have spent that much without the gift certificate. Highly recommend if you like upscale and don't mind paying that much for an excellent meal.",Blue Morel Restaurant and Wine Bar,2 Whippany Rd
24994,51,78,American,1,05/20/2017,"It was a disaster. Fake food , fake service, fake people with fake smiles. And way overpriced. Apparently the chef doesn't know the difference between  ""medium rare"" and ""raw"" ... or how to choose a lamb meat for the rack of lamb. I don't mind to pay premium for the good rack of lamb, but there should be meat, not just chewy uncooked fat on the bones. And for that price I would expect some original sauce on top. Yes - cooking was supposed to be an art, not just a way to extort people's money. And the service...seriously? You charge over $200 for dinner for two and cannot find two lazy waiters to sing a stupid ""Happy Birthday"" song?",Blue Morel Restaurant and Wine Bar,2 Whippany Rd
24995,52,78,American,1,05/20/2018,"It's too expensive for the service provided.  We had the Thanksgiving dinner and we were given small COLD portions... seafood pasta dish was robbery... barely two tablespoons of seafood..the ice cream in the desert was a SINGLE mellon ball or grape sized scoop.. THAT was 64 DOLLARS for each person.    BTW Rich, that's the same experience we had a few years ago with zero improvement.

Requested a table for 1 at 1:45 pm and they walked new through the whole restaurante to the only table without table Clothes at the corner of the bar after asking me if I was ok with a cocktail table. The bartender who was shewing gum was terrible, she went to take my order after 10 minutes waiting.  I felt they were lazy and dindnt care for me as their customer. I wish management can take action on this unless they want to keep receiving a bad score. Lazy, bad, bad, lazy. So much money invested on this place to have so many lazy people working.",Blue Morel Restaurant and Wine Bar,2 Whippany Rd

24999,56,78,American,4,05/20/2019,"Beautiful restaurant. Food was excellent! Service was good until the end of the meal. We were forgotten albeit, we were next to the waiter's station.  Waited 20 mins for the check.",Blue Morel Restaurant and Wine Bar,2 Whippany Rd
25000,57,78,American,2,05/20/2016,"I went to Blue Morel for lunch.    I struggled with giving them 2 stars, I wish there were a way to rate the restaurant at 2.5 stars.    I had both the shrimp cocktail and crab cake as an appetizer, and the duck tacos as an entre (suggested by my waitress).    The shrimp cocktail at Morel was a different spin on the dish; 4 boiled jumbo shrimp with a side of house made cocktail sauce. Unexpected, but fair.    The crab cake was slightly greasy but otherwise prepared well. They use a bountiful amount of crab with minimal filler and it was seasoned nicely.    My entre, however, left a lot to be desired. Eaten alone...the duck was inedible. So salty that I wondered if it was mistake.  The tacos are presented in the style of Mexican street tacos, topped with Watermelon radishes, avacado and a delightful sauce on a corn tortilla. Eaten as a taco, the rest of the unseasoned accompaniments blended decently enough.    As there was a bartender on duty, I asked my waitress if she could suggest a specialty cocktail beit regional favorite or house specialty. This was returned with an odd look and the response of ""he can pretty much make whatever you want""    Pretty easy to see where the 2 star review comes from. I suppose the extra half star would be for the decor. It's a beautifully decorated restaurant.",Blue Morel Restaurant and Wine Bar,2 Whippany Rd
25001,58,78,American,1,05/20/2016,Overpriced for no reason!  Had the brunch and the seafood was bad so I stopped eating it and as i walked out i found another quest stating that yesterday they had the same problem with the sea food.  And unfortunately this man was part of a party and they all got sick.  Now one day later I'm not feeling well.  The advertised price for the buffet was different than what i was charged.,Blue Morel Restaurant and Wine Bar,2 Whippany Rd
25002,59,78,American,1,05/20/2018,"We had Thanksgiving pre-fix dinner.  The menu write up was inspiring.  The meal that came out was not.  The pasta dish was described as Squid Ink Tagliatelle (Butter poached king crab, Rosamarina sauce, roasted squash, citrus toasted bread crumbs).  Yes the pasta was there.  The king crab and squash were placed under the pasta and was about one tablespoon of crab and one tablespoon of squash at a maximum.  It came out cold and I had to pull out crab shell from my mouth when there should not have been any.  We were not offered any coffee, tea, or anything else at dessert.  The meals did not warrant the cost",Blue Morel Restaurant and Wine Bar,2 Whippany Rd

The atmosphere was nice but the service was average. My biggest complaint was the single tiny scallop as an appitezer. It was almost insulting when it came to the table and I thought it was joke.

Private party room restaurant/bar. Bathroom very clean uses real towel to wipe hands .Food for the sweet 16 birthday menus varies  good portion . I had the lamb and mashed potato which was delicious. Meat was very tender. . Carrots were not as tender. I had to take some of my lamb home. Drinks were good.,Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St
34547,4,123,American,5,02/24/2023,"Beautiful restaurant located on the water overlooking NYC. Service was everything you should expect from an upscale restaurant. A good wine menu with very reasonable prices.  Now to the food lol...  We had the Atlantic oysters and grilled Octopus as appetizers, both were good. The sea bass was to die for and the dessert sampler is definitely a must.",Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St
34548,5,123,American,4,05/25/2022,"I liked the place. The view is amazing, staff friendly and cheerful. The ambiance was superb. I read that drinks didn’t taste good -quite the opposite, l had a glass of Rose and it was just fine.    The only thing l didn’t like were the unpolished wine glasses and the scratched flatware.    It’s a nice place overall- would visit again :)",Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St

34552,9,123,American,5,10/27/2022,Their brunch has the variety one would expect from a class act restaurant. The oysters were fresh and included a nice variety of sauces. The Lobster Benedict was pared with a perfection of flavors and the Bloody Mary was a step above the norm.  Danny was the perfect gentleman who answered all my questions. Not for brunch but also some sites to see.  It is a shame I live 30 hours away. Haha!,Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St
34553,10,123,American,4,08/28/2022,Great ambiance! Brunch was superb! I suggest the $39 Prix Fixe .. comes with 2 glasses of mimosa. The tuna tartare was great as well. The service was awesome. Highly recommend this establishment.,Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St

34555,12,123,American,4,06/29/2022,"My husband and I were seated outside which was great.The breeze and the view of the water was pleasant. It took our waitress a little while before she came to the table to greet us. By time she did we already knew what we wanted for our appetizer & entrees. We were unsure about what cocktails we’d like but our waitress provided great & simple suggestions. I ordered pacific oysters, lobster Mac and the branzino. My husband only wanted wings from this place but he enjoyed them very much. EVERYTHING was so DELICIOUS. The only thing that could’ve deserved more attention were my potatoes that came with my branzino- they were on the harder side. However, I really enjoyed my meal & experience overall. I left with a huge smile on my face… well done ",Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St
34556,14,123,American,5,10/27/2022,Varied menu very good food and service with scenic views of Manhattan. Outdoor heated dining available (was October).  Large bar lounge. Lunch and dinner. When main dining room filled up it became noisy and hard to hear conversation. Good dessert choices.,Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St
34557,15,123,American,2,12/26/2022,"Mediocre food in a nice setting overlooking the Hudson River.    Beet salad had two pieces of beets.  I did like their cauliflower appetizer dish.  Seafood risotto was decent in terms of the amount of seafood it had, but was bland as were most of the dishes we ordered. Portions were on the smaller side. My expectations for quality and taste didn't match up to the price. If you're looking for a nice ambiance and don't care about the food (eg. drinks and some small appetizers), this is a good place.    They have a $5 cake cutting fee PER PERSON. You have 5 people? They will gladly collect a $25 fee and cut the cake for you into uneven pieces so some people get a massive slice while others get a sliver. Thankfully the manager stepped in and helped us with this, so kudos to her for making us happy.    In addition to the cake cutting fee:  (1) Mandatory 20% service charge on parties 6 or more.  (2) Mandatory credit card processing fee if you don't pay in cash.",Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St
34558,16,123,American,5,03/26/2023,I don’t even know where to begin. Wish I could give them 10 stars. My partner brought me here for my birthday and from the moment we walked in we loved it. It is gorgeous and the views are spectacular. Our server Luis was the sweetest & most attentive server that we could have asked for. His knowledge of the menu ensured that we ordered the perfect plates.  We started off with the oyster sampler platter  and every bite was perfection. They came with all sorts of sauces but the oysters were so fresh that you really didn’t need them.  For our entrees we ordered the Branzino & the Short Ribs and I couldn’t even tell you which one was better. The flavor of both dishes was like nothing we’ve ever experienced.  My cocktail of choice was the Lychee martini and it was spectacular.  We even got a check in from the manager in duty who was so nice and made sure that the entire night ran so smoothly.  We will definitely be back to this gem!,Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St
34559,17,123,American,5,07/29/2022,First of all the staff is tremendous…. Second The manager Greg hooked us up with some great seats after our reservation time and seating was altered by extra people I wanted to be there. Customer service . After all it was going to be a proposal surprise for my girlfriend. Which only a few knew … on this Special occasion required a special waitress and her name was Rae. Definitely made our night great. She definitely was on point the whole night from the minute we sat down and got us drinks to get started but she also knew her mission which she chose to gladly accept and made it happen..Drinks came pretty quick in which I needed to overcome the fear lol. Everyone loved the food selection from the appetizers to the main course also to the dessert. Which was the sign that the Champagne was coming right after and then it was my turn to propose…. man old man everyone did great thanks again Haven Riverfront restaurant staff yeah the random people congratulations us. You guys will definitely be our favorite choice for future events and hope it’s everyone’s as well!,Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St

Sword fish was cooked to perfection. Apple dessert was the finishing touch!  Highly recommend it!,Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St
34561,19,123,American,5,09/27/2022,"Was searching for a nice restaurant with amazing views of the water for brunch with a friend for their birthday.  There was valet parking upon arrival with reservation.  We did the brunch special (Brunch Prix Fixe) with 1 mimosa, 1 bellini, and 1 entree each ($40/person - 2 drinks each and one entree each).  Keep in mind, the pricing for this place is on the higher end.  For the brunch entree, I ordered the french toast.  Both the drinks and food came out very quickly with very little wait time.  The drinks and food were so, so delicious!  Our server was very attentive and polite.    Overall, this was a perfect scenic and pleasant spot for an upscale brunch with drinks.",Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St

34563,21,123,American,5,05/25/2022,"So my friend and I went here for lunch before spending a relaxing day at Sojo.  We got there just as it opened. The food was really good. We got a bunch of the appetizers as we couldn't decide what to eat. I'd definitely recommend anyone who loves oysters to get the ""travel around world"" oysters. They give you 4 oysters each of the different ones they have in stock. It's more cost efficient then getting them separately.    We got the short rib bruschetta (really good), truffle Mac n cheese, tuna tartare, Carolina wings (really good and not overly sauced), oysters and then for dessert the chocolate croissant bread pudding.  The dessert wasn't overwhelming which was good. I got the blood orange martini and it was refreshing.    Would come again to this place by the water.",Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St
34564,23,123,American,3,08/28/2022,"This was my first time at this restaurant. I believe the experience begins from the moment you enter and the hostess greets you. My experience was she was not very friendly and would rather chat with her coworkers than acknowledge her guest. We ordered the around the world oysters, when they came to the table we weren’t educated which oysters were which. The short rib bruschetta lacked flavor. The salmon tasted fishy, in a bad way. The short rib entree had a delightful porto sauce and the crispy potatoes that came with the dish were tasty. Our waitress was attentive. In conclusion, nothing impressive about the food, this is one of the restaurants in which you come once to try and do not come back.",Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St
34565,24,123,American,5,05/25/2022,Such a Beautiful view! We came here to celebrate our anniversary. I’m so happy we came. The food was amazing.

The view is (of course) beautiful but I have had better overall experiences in the other restaurants on this strip. I knocked off two stars because I value flavor and service pretty highly and both were lacking . We were here on a Wednesday for our anniversary and the hostesses were very sweet but the waiter was extremely cold and unwelcoming . It felt like pulling teeth to receive any interaction from him . It wasn’t busy so i was a bit confusing to see him rush through service with us . The food came and it was pretty average/lacked flavor.. considering it’s a high end restaurant, I definitely expected more . I had the shrimp pasta and my husband and daughter both ordered steak, which was bland .",Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St

34576,37,123,American,5,07/29/2022,I would definitely recommend the lobster benedict! I get it every time Haven has the best (I’ve tried different restaurants lobster benedict). They cook their lobster PERFECT so it’s not rubbery like other places. There brunch is affordable around $40 which includes one preselected brunch item and two mimosas or Bellini.,Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St

34578,39,123,American,3,03/26/2023,"The atmosphere and service is nice but the food could have been tastier.   We started at the bar where we ordered a limon drop and old fashion.  My friends wanted a congac base drink but they didn't offer any.  I've come to learn that places that don't offer congac doesn't like a certain demographic going there.  The appetizers was the best part of the meal.  We had the oysters, firecracker shrimp, and tuna tartare (which was ok).  I had the filet which was dry an lacked flavor.  My friend said the salmon was ok.  For the price of the food I expected and had better at other restaurants.",Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St

We were served drinks and asked if we knew our choices. We order the appetizers shrimp and the dinner steaks with asparagus as a side. We were in an out in less than an hour. I felt for the amount they charged (bill was well over $200), we should of been there a little longer. The food was good, our server was wonderful but when I spend that kind of money I kind of just want to see back enjoy for a while. (It wasn’t a Saturday,(usually your busiest) it was a Sunday night and the restaurant was not crowded.

There are a lot of choices for various tastes. You will find something you like there, and it will be fantastic.    And the view!

You have the option to sit inside or outside. I suggest you make a reservation. The ambiance inside is romantic. The drinks are nice, and strong. The food wasn't bad. I enjoyed the raw oysters. However, I didn't enjoy the Lobster Croquettes. It didn't have enough seasoning to me; it was bland. The N.Y. Strip steak was prepared well, with Shrimp on top with at extra cost.

Their menu has some great appetizers. We loved the Octopus to start of. It was not burned, accompanied by green sea weed like vegetables.    For entree we had the risotto and duck with Singapore noodles. The risotto is made with black rice and lots of seafood. Singapore noodles lacked seasoning, it would have been great if they cooked the noodles on th same sauce as the duck.    Throghout our dining, the service was pretty average. Our server was way too busy. I had to wait about 20 mins to get my mochito order in. Similarly at the end of our dinner, took me about 10-15 minutes to get my check.

I got smoked salmon Benedict which was great. Their espresso martini was good although I'd have preferred whole coffee beans in there instead of crushed. Service was good too although the person at the front was busy chatting away on the phone than handle the walk-ins.    On and all - it was a good experience.",Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St

The setup is pretty nice however the service wasn’t that great. Our waiter was very nice but the rest of the staff, you fee they have that attitude of hating what they do.  The server came with 2 pieces of bread which didn’t look good at all, when I asked him to grab me different piece, he told me they ran out and those are the last 2 pieces!!!! Why would you offer them then if they are not looking good ??    Food was great, the steak was delicious though I have had better ones and less expensive in fancier places.  Another server came by and put an empty plate in front of me. When I told her I didn’t ask for one, she said: just keep it here in case!!!    At the end, it’s one time experience and I wouldn’t try again!! There are much better places around there.

The prices have been jacked up while overall quality fallen. Only good things are great views and clean washrooms. Sad to see another pandemic causalty.",Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St

Improvements can certainly be made with more courteous staff.    The location is picturesque and outdoor seating is nicely setup.  Food is great - presentation and taste was great.  However (again) service seemed deficient and could be improved.    This would be a 3 star review, if not for the location and the food!",Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St
34609,70,123,American,5,05/25/2022,"This was one of the best spots I've been with a great view. The food was delish!  my husband and I went there for lunch, so from the lunch menu I had the entree Grilled Churrasco Skirt steak with potatoes and salad. For dessert, chocolate mousse. The service was great, the waiter was attentive and made sure we were good with our order. Ambiance is family friendly also, and the background music is low enough so you can talk. All in all, it was a great experience. Definitely recommending this place",Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St

The mussel, tuna tartare and oysters were great appetizers. The steak and eggs, chicken sandwich and salmon were very good choices.",Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St

They were extraordinary: flexible in accommodating us, understanding about the nature of the occasion, and so communicative. They even organized valet parking. Fiona was our point of contact, and she was superb.    And the food was exactly what we needed -- delicious, healthy comfort. The views, as many others have shared, were also great.",Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St
34614,75,123,American,5,04/25/2023,"Service was great, my chicken salad was much better than expected. When I go to a place on the water I don’t have high expectations because I’ve been let down so often by other restaurants around, especially in Weehawken. But at Haven the food was great and the service was great. Prices are comparable to everywhere else in the area so that wasn’t a surprise. Would definitely recommend.",Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St

34619,80,123,American,5,05/25/2021,"They have valet parking for $6 (upfront), parking could be an issue. View is nice, staff is nice. Waited 15 minutes passed our reservation time, but it was Easter Sunday. Pretzel crusted calamari and mussels for app, both were amazing.  I'm a carb-gal and the toast/garlic bread that came with the mussels was amazing dipped in the mussel's 'sauce'.  I had short ribs with roasted veggies and truffle potatoes.  The short ribs were delicious, veggies were kind of bland, but good.  Husband had ribeye and brussels sprouts.  Brussels sprouts were ok, not much seasoning, ribeye was delish. Cheesecake for dessert, it was good- I've had better. Husband had warm brownie with ice cream, unfortunately it had peanuts on it so I couldn't have much, but it was really good. Everything was really good, thats why the 5-stars, but overall it wasn't anything out of the ordinary.",Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St

The table where I reserved was near the window where I was able to watch New York lights in a very nice restaurant. Everything was just beautiful. The reason why they received a three star from me is not because of the place or staffs it is because of the flavor of the food. The sea bass was amazing according to my person, however, I did the mistake of ordering a risotto which was not so appetizing to me. It altered the mood to be honest. They should just remove it off the menu. Staff was top of the line. Restaurant is very clean  and be well dressed when going to this place. Tip the staff they’re hard workers you’ll see them running around. I put a picture of the food below. Enjoy your dinner!!",Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St

It's sexy, with a good looking cast of clientele. The staff is so friendly, attentive, cordial and just understand what customer service means.    At one point I confused a guest with my server. She laughed, and said she is off today but actually works here. Can you believe she helped us with our menu questions anyway?    Whatever they're doing with selecting, training and supporting talent is working. Who goes to hang at their job on their day off unless they really dig the spot!    The food... Listen... I used to bulk at the prices when I looked at the menu. Places here can be expensive and not worth it. The food is DELICIOUS!!!! I came in here very hungry, and couldn't finish my food. The servings are abundant!    I cannot wait to come back here. I only feel this way about a few places on the Gold Coast. Happy to have another chic spot to patronize. And, of special note, this crowd is purposefully chic and diverse. I'm diggin' it!    Thanks for a great experience.",Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St

34630,91,123,American,4,05/25/2021,"Haven is a beautiful restaurant with amazing views plus the food is good!  We had southwestern chicken spring rolls and the shrimp firecracker for appetizers.  The southwestern spring rolls were just ok not worth ordering again.  However, we did enjoy the salsa fresca dipping sauce it came with.  The shrimp firecracker was far better and really good!  For dinners we had the 10 ounce filet mignon and the swordfish.  The filet mignon was excellent!  It had such a delicious char flavor, and it was cooked just how I requested it well done.  The swordfish was topped with a generous amount of crab meat!  It was so good!  We also ordered a side of gemelli lobster Mac and cheese which was horrible!  Trust me and don’t order it!  It wasn’t cheesy at all, and it was all dried out!  Even the lobster meat was dried out too!  You can’t really make a good Mac and cheese with gemelli pasta anyway.  For dessert we had the chocolate bread pudding and the brownie.  The bread pudding was delicious!  I loved it!  The brownie was a good.  I recommend dining at Haven Restaurant & Bar in Edgewater!",Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St

Very tender with a very fresh flavor.  The fried chicken Benedict was yummy, Crunchy and tender at the same time.  The steak and eggs were perfectly seasoned and super tender. But the best part of this whole wonderful dining experience was our server Dani.  She was pleasant, professional and on top of everything!  She was our server/bartender and was AWESOME!

We went to bar first and had some drinks & appetizers. We then moved to the dinner room. We ate inside and it wasnt so crowded. There are tables outside too. We have the octopus to start and it was great. I had the Chilean sea bass as an entree and it was so good. It comes in a bowl and has a miso sauce on side.

The waitstaff was very very nice, and our waiter was extremely informative when he had asked if anyone was vegan or had a gluten allergy. I was extremely impressed by the view of the city, the layout & design of the restaurant, all the way down to the plates & silverware. We had ordered the Shrimp Firecracker as a starter; highly recommend; Espresso Martini, and Rosemary Martini, both tasted great, but did not taste a lick of alcohol. As our main course, we ordered the Roasted Duck and the Char Grilled Branzino. The food was absolutely amazing, however, the was a little too much salt cooked within the dish. We would definitely love to come here again when the weather is nice to enjoy an outdoor dining experience, or any intimate occasion in the future!

They were serving their Valentine's pre-fixe menu on both Vday and the day after which was great for people who couldn't secure a reservation for the day of. Dinner and the view was amazing here. Hospitality was great and staff was very friendly and courteous with smiles. The price was just about right for the quality of food. My only downside was my steak. While I asked for medium well it was more towards well done, making it tough to chew. Everyone makes steak differently. I've gone to other restaurants where medium well was more towards medium which I prefer. So it's hard to gauge what each chef's idea is when cooking meat. Drinks were made well. Desserts were rich and filling. At the very end, all ladies dining were given a small box of chocolate-super cute touch to make us feel special.",Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St
34647,109,123,American,4,04/25/2023,"While visiting the area for a show across the bridge, I wanted a nice restaurant with a view close to my hotel (Homewood Suites) and located two options. It rained the Saturday morning I went to Haven Riverfront Restaurant so I wasn't too disappointed when I called an hour prior to wanting a table in the main dining area. The hostess did inform me that they had bar seating available on a first-come first-serve basis.    When my partner and I arrived a little after 1PM, there were quite a few tables available in the bar area. It was a nice option to do the pre-fixe brunch for $39 which includes one brunch item and a choice of (2) mimosas, bellinis, or bloody marys.    I ordered the American Breakfast which included your choice of eggs, bacon, potatoes, (3) mini pancakes, and a salad.    The portion size was perfect. The potatoes were very delicious. The bacon slab which very thick but had a lot of fat so I picked off the extra fat. The mini pancakes were yummy and included a small carafe of syrup. What was missing was some salad dressing for the small salad also on the plate. We ordered (1) of each mimosa and bellini.    The service was very good but the bill was a little bit of a surprise. When I saw pre-fixe for $39, I was expecting to see a $39 charge for each of our meals and that was not the case. My partner ordered the steak and eggs brunch item and was charged $47 while my American Breakfast was priced at $39. So with the drinks having a price of $9 each, we were not charged a pre-fixe price. We were charged the menu price of our meal plus 2 drinks each which is fine but it's not what I was expecting.",Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St

Very quick to clean our tables and bring the food out in a timely manner.  My only complaint is the restaurant being greedy. They charge a service fee for using your credit card. I’ll say this once, and i’ll say this over and over again until I’m heard. I spent close to $240 on dinner for two people at Haven. If you’re going to be greedy to make the customer pay a few bucks on a CC transaction fee, you lost a lifelong customer. I had enough with the BS of covid destroyed businesses etc. if you cannot afford to pay a few dollars on a credit card transaction fee when your restaurant is raking in thousands every day and night, i believe its time to close the shop. Seriously. From one small business owner to another. You don’t even see cheap takeouts that costs $10 for a meal charge the CC fee. It’s embarrassing….. Therefore, I’m giving 3 stars.",Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St

The food was actually very delicious. The New Zealand mussels are incredible. I would definitely go back just for the mussels. The food is top notch. I have no complaints with the food. Only complaint I have was the drinks weren’t really that good. A little too bitter for my taste and the waiter made us feel a little rushed.

We asked if we could wait outside since it is so beautiful they said yes and that they would call us as soon as a table open. Well 45 mins passed by and no call so we decided to walk in again when we got there we there were like 3 tables empty outside. We know this things happen specially if it is a busy Friday and since we enjoyed the view we'll give 5 stars.  PS. Best steak ever.,Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St

Lovely for a beautiful summer night.,Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St
34662,124,123,American,3,05/25/2020,Great view. Overpriced food for the taste. The ambiance is intimate. Dim lighting and a view of the city. Drinks are tasty but not anything worth remembering. We ordered the pretzel crusted calamari which was decent. The burrata and heirloom tomato salad lacked actual burrata. The braised Omaha lamb shank was extremely tender and pleasurable to eat but I feel like the plate lacked elements besides the meat itself. Churrasco was just okay.

I ordered the all American breakfast wondering what their take would be on such a simple dish. It comes with eggs, bacon, salad, and pancakes. Everything was absolutely delicious! Bacon was extra thick cut. I ordered my eggs scrambled lightly. The pancakes were light and heavenly. The value for the price was also ideal. Highly recommend!",Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St

Yet, we had plenty of time to eat.",Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St

We called as we were running a few minutes late and the host was understanding and so sweet. Upon arrival our waiter greeted us with happy anniversary! The food was delicious (octopus, calamari, filet mignon, ribeye, and loaded mashed potatoes) to finish the night off we were given complimentary champagne! The views of NYC were the perfect touch as well. Even though we are 1.5 hours away we can’t wait to return. Thank you Haven!",Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St
34666,128,123,American,4,05/25/2021,Nice place to go on a date or have a bday dinner at. Interior is well decorated and the outdoor seating has fantastic views.

34671,133,123,American,5,05/25/2020,"Waterfront dining in unexpectedly elegant surroundings.. Edgewater New Jersey is proving to be a hidden gem. The steaks were expertly grilled, crabcakes were dense with a big flake  + not much breading. Salads arrived dresses with a lemony vinaigrette + bright crunch leave, making them a perfect foil to the rich steaks. Martinis are shaken to each drinkers liking + the wine list was plentiful without becoming pretentious. Prices are a bit below the range of New York City staples, but the quality of the food, service + style are exactly on par.",Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St

I had the vegetariam omelette which was made with fresh ingredients and had a hummus stuffing. I did not like their breakfast potatoes, they had an excessive amount of oil which did not pair well with my healthy omelette. My mother had the steak and eggs and did not like the fact that the skirt steak was already sliced up. bread was not available but we got a couple slices of toast for an additional fee. I had brought a small personal cake and they were very courteous to cut it up for me and my 3 guest for an additional fee of $12.  The bloody mary was good and it had the right amount of vodka in it.",Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St
34676,138,123,American,3,05/25/2022,The place was modest...just keep in mind if you have a big party they take a max of 4 cards.

34677,139,123,American,5,05/25/2022,"Had lunch here to celebrate my mother’s birthday, and we had a great time! First and foremost, the hostess Abby was very accommodating, our reservation was for 12:30 but we had to push it back an hour as we were running behind and she made the changes. When we got in she also was able to accommodate us outside as it was a beautiful day! The restaurant has a stunning view of NYC. Our server, Jade was very sweet and very accommodating to our severe mushroom allergy. We had the Kumamoto oysters as well as the Short rib Bruschetta to start (it was to die for) we love oysters and have never tried the Kumamoto and holy cow, they were so good! For our mains we had the strip steak and the shrimp linguini also very good! For our favorite part of the meal (dessert) we got the Apple Churro cobbler, (the staff added a candle and wished my mom a happy birthday) it was very sweet! Who knew a churro cobbler would be so delicious?! We very happily wiped the plate clean! We will definitely be back and can’t wait to come in and try the dinner menu. Thank you Haven & team for making my mom’s birthday lunch so lovely!",Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St

34679,141,123,American,3,10/27/2022,"I will not come back! The menu is complicated. I came with 4 people and we all had to ask questions about the menu.  Several prices for each menu. Very confusing and  overpriced.  All of my friends didn't have the 2nd mimosa. I guess it wasn't that good.  Although the food, server, and ambience is good.  I don't like  when the menu is not straightforward.  One of the ladies was told  she will be billed the lower price with mimosa but charged the higher price.",Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St

34681,143,123,American,3,05/25/2021,"Great food, but was seated for brunch around 12:30pm in the blazing sun. Although, they kept bringing us ice to cool off,  it was unbearable for children. I would suggest to invest in a canopy for all guest instead of making other people feel less fortunate for not making the cut for the VIP part with the canopy.",Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St
34682,144,123,American,2,08/28/2022,"Service was spot on. The appetizer of char grilled wakame octopus was delicious, the salad of burrata & heirloom tomato is also delicious.  Seafood risotto was to say the least, disappointing.",Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St

I took her here a few years ago on Valentine's Day and we had a wonderful dining experience.  I looked at some of the recent reviews and was pretty shocked to see a few low ratings and was hoping that our experience would live up to our previous experience.  Well, it didn't.  It was even BETTER this time around!    Our server was fantastic.  He was attentive enough to refill our water and wine glasses and to check on us periodically but wasn't overbearing like some waiters can be.  He recommended the shrimp firecracker as an appetizer and it was right on the money.  We also both had the Super Tuscan wine which was very good.  Our Filet Mignon was lightly seasoned and cooked to perfection (medium rare).  We ordered the dessert sampler for two and our waiter surprised us by saying ""your dessert is on the house - happy anniversary""!    We couldn't have asked for a better dining experience and will continue to frequent Haven and recommend this fine restaurant to all of our friends!",Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St

34691,154,123,American,4,05/25/2020,We went here on a Friday night and sat outside. Was a really nice atmosphere. The menu choices are amazing. I chose the spareribs with crispy potatoes and a poached egg and au jous.  Amazing. They also treated us for our anniversary which had already passed. The only negative was the wine list was expensive.,Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St
34692,155,123,American,4,05/25/2021,"The service was great and the food was very good and very nice to look at. I had the salmon and my husband had the chicken sandwich, we shared the short rib bruschetta appetizer. My salmon was perfectly cooked and very striking to look at but was actually bland. My husband's chicken sandwich was the most juicy, lighter than air, crispy delicious sandwich! We shared a Bailey's cream brulee and that was crispy, boozy goodness. We will definitely be back but we'll make a reservation, so that we are not stuck on the sidewalk in blazing heat. Such a nice restaurant,  I'm not sure why they don't have umbrellas down on the sidewalk by the water's edge. It would have been a very nice place to sit if not for the glaring hot sun.",Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St

Loaded mash was good.    Wife had fish tacos as an appetizer and she love them. She ordered salmon and it was cooked medium rare.    Drinks are good and the views are excellent. The Wait staff, bartender and hostess were friendly and attentive.    In a nutshell, go for drinks and enjoy the views. Maybe have an appetizer.

Our waitress, Michelle very personable and the assistant waiters, and bus boys were very accommodating.

I definitely feel as though you are paying for the scenery while the food is not that great. The food is overprice and nothing is special about it. I enjoyed my Strawberry Field and appetizer more than my actual entree. This is restaurant where you pay more for the ""experience"" than the meal. It's not worth the 100 per person for lunch.",Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St

34708,171,123,American,1,11/26/2022,"Unfortunately, can't leave a ZERO or negative review on here.  I was there on Friday night with a party of five.  At first we thought the view on the water was going to make things great but we were wrong!!.  The ridiculous prices coupled by the really bad lighting was a small part of what makes this place a STAY AWAY PLACE.  The service was very nice until the end when the server hosts you with "" by the way we add the tip to parties if five or more""!  I may be able to understand that since some people don't tip.  They should haCe that somewhere in writing not when you are done with the meal.  If it is, nobody can see it in the dim lights.  But the unbelievable part is that THEY CHARGE YOU A CREDIT CARD FEE!!!!!.  So our dinner was over $400 and some tables had 8-10 people with means over $1000.  Do they really think people walk around with that kind of cash on them?  What if you don't have a cash app?  Absolutely outrageous with they prices they are charging!!.  Completely and absolute scam and I don't know.if it is even legal.  Nevertheless, this one thing destroys anything good that yhe place has to offer.  Was fair and the service was decent.  Nothing to justify the insane pricing or fees.  Stay away at all cost.  Many other better and less expensive places to go.  Just read all the other negative reviews.

I've been served everything bad there from brown lettuce to dry, warmed over chicken & coffee made with dishwater.  Probably safest to just eat some appetizers. Wait service is always nice, but what goes on in that kitchen is sub par. There's more consistency at IHOP than at Haven.",Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St

When bringing out the food the manager on duty serves the food to the person that have a food allergy first and reassure that it's safe to eat. I love Fiona who is one of the managers.

(despite asking to turn it down) I thought this place was a restaurant, not a lounge. The drinks were incredibly overpriced, and not quality-even straightforward and simple cocktails. Overall food, bread wasn’t amazing. Unfortunately the hostess wasn’t helpful or gracious. Best part of the night was the seafood risotto (highly recommend) and distant view of midtown Manhattan skyline.",Haven Riverfront Restaurant and Bar,2 Main St

Decor was also very good.  We had the pretzel crusted calamare, which was the best part of the meal. As a main course my wife had the short ribs. They were dry and a little tough.

We did get our food which was good, but on the other there was one family that waited over an hour for a pizza that they didn't even eat because it wasn't to their liking, so with on the menu they spieficy that the bread of the pizza is made out of  quesadilla bread",The Avenue Restaurant & Bar,71-22 Myrtle Ave

35135,26,126,American,4,05/25/2020,I have been there many times food is great. The only downfall is it takes a while for the food to come to your table.Average is about 30- 40 minutes. It's not the server's cuz you can get as many drinks as you want while you're waiting. Also had a great time at two comedy shows,The Avenue Restaurant & Bar,71-22 Myrtle Ave

My son wanted french fries from McDonalds, but I felt it's important to support small businesses, especially after the lockdown.  I ordered him a plain hamburger, medium well, french fries and got a side of onion rings too.  When I got home, the burger was rare, barely cooked, and had cheese on it. The onion rings are horrible, like Ore Ida chopped onion rings.  I called, The Avenue to let them know the order was not correct. I still had the receipt it said med well no cheese. Even though I spoke to a manager, nothing was done to make this a better experience or want to go back..  May be a good place to drink and hang out, but I think twice about ordering food to go here.",The Avenue Restaurant & Bar,71-22 Myrtle Ave

37652,0,143,American,5,10/28/2022,"What a gorgeous restaurant. We made sure to get there early so we had time to explore the beautiful furniture and decor throughout the floors leading up to the rooftop. The restaurant itself is stunning, staff was so kind, they gave us complimentary drinks to celebrate our anniversary, and the food was delicious! Surprisingly not as expensive as I would have originally thought! Our favorites were the crispy artichokes, truffle fries, and chocolate chip cookies.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37653,1,143,American,5,05/26/2022,After shift dinner: to unwind and for my birthday celebration. My friend invited me here. I so love the ambiance. Some servers are professional. Ours is so-so.

Look how beautiful the place is  Relaxing.,RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37654,2,143,American,4,11/27/2022,"Went to this restaurant for my spouses birthday. The aesthetic of the place is beautiful. The view from above is breathtaking. The food was delicious and the waiter was pleasant enough. One drawback I would say is I wish their menu had more variety. I wanted shrimp but was told its served cold and I wanted steam. I would have even settled for cooked but not cold, was told there was no exception. There was two options for seating outer roof (where you could look and see the sky)and inside, would have preferred outside not sure if a specific appointment has to be made for that probably so. Visited October 11 2022",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37655,3,143,American,5,07/30/2022,"Beautiful dining room with elegant rooftop. Our server Ernie ensured we had a wonderful dining experience. All items are cooked to perfection.    if you are in the mood for steak but not a large portion, the carved steak sandwich it delicious.    I highly recommend making a reservation.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37656,4,143,American,5,06/30/2022,"It's such a beautiful place, the food, the music and the atmosphere all go so well together. It was a happy breakfast.  Avocado toast is a taste I want to eat again.  After the meal, the showroom with stylish furniture is the strength of this place.  We found our favorite home interior here.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37657,5,143,American,5,08/29/2022,"Loved this place!    The atmosphere is gorgeous and service was great. Amazing views of the city and a summer outdoor dining must. The inside of the restaurant was also gorgeous.    The food is perhaps what surprised me the most. For the apps, we got the burrata, fried artichoke, and the brie. All were excellent.    The salads were great. Loved the chicken as well. The lobster roll was the only miss. Will definitely be back here!",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37658,6,143,American,5,03/27/2023,"Food is drop dead AMAZING. If you like truffle, the truffle grilled cheese sandwich and truffle fries a must. We had the Arugula salad as well for some fresh palate cleansing - delicious. The location of this restaurant is in the Meatpacking District, which is perfect as you can go for a walk around to enjoy the location, including the Chelsea market.  highly recommended.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37659,7,143,American,5,10/28/2022,Second time at RH and first time at NYC location. The interior and the taste of food is actually consistent! It seems hard to do but the have the same menu and you’d be surprise how good the food is coming to a furniture shop. The weather was perfect and we sat on the patio. Perfect amount of green among all these brick buildings. The previous location I went was in Chicago,RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37660,8,143,American,5,07/30/2022,RH never disappoints. The rooftop restaurant has great ambiance beautiful decor. The food was amazing. The pork belly bacon and the shaved rib with jus were exceptional. Would recommend this place for the complete experience. You can get some furniture too after eating!,RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37661,9,143,American,5,06/30/2022,"Great atmosphere, very Instagram friendly.  The vibes was dope. Nice music in the background and police sirens in the distance. Perfect balance. The food  was fulfilling. I got a Caesar salad and it was huge. It had avocado in it which was different but good. I would recommend this place for a nice cute date. Wouldn’t recommend the truffle fries, not for $20 at least",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37662,10,143,American,3,11/27/2022,This is a very fancy place.!! We wanted to have experience of fine dining and we came. Should book table if you want to sit outside and not inside. Very expensive place. If you want to come for good view from roof top then I wouldn’t recommend but just for experience of fine dining then you surely should come.!,RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37663,11,143,American,3,12/27/2022,Decor is very nice at this restoration hardware rooftop restaurant.  Don’t expect any real drinks as they do not have a full liquor license.  The food choices were limited but we found stuff to eat.  Quality of food is good. Staff was attentive to our needs and food was fast to come out.  Overall nice place for pictures but the menu can use some work.,RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37664,12,143,American,5,07/30/2022,"Ambience: Among the best I’ve experienced.    Food: We had the roasted chicken, ribeye steak, grilled salmon, broccolini and wild mushrooms and some Italian appetizers. We could tell that these dishes were made by a skilled chef. We enjoyed every item we ordered and would order them again.    Service: Our waiter was very professional and attended to us in a timely fashion.    I took a few photos of our food. Enjoy!",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37665,13,143,American,4,01/26/2023,"Beautiful decor, top notch service, a little overrated.  We came here for brunch on a Sunday at 2pm with reservations. Definitely need reservations to come here. There are so many floors to see designs and styles, leading up to the rooftop.  Fancy vibe, but there wasn’t anything special about the food or drinks.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37666,14,143,American,5,05/26/2022,"One of the best places for ambience in the city. Both indoor and outdoor seating is beautiful. Food is tasty. Price is reasonable and worth the experience. Avocado toast and truffle fries tasted great. My only disappointment was that they didn't have french toast or pancakes for brunch.    Went on a Monday and the place was still full. So, make your reservations early.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37667,15,143,American,5,05/26/2022,we had 11:15 reservation outside and were seated on time pleasantly. Inside restaurant was very busy but outside seating area seem very roomy and not crowded at all. I worry about cold weather but heater worked very well and we were comfortable without jackets. Our waiter was very nice!!! and the food was good the view was good. We all enjoyed the time there.,RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37668,16,143,American,5,08/29/2022,"RH Rooftop is sleek, elegant and exactly the vibe you and the gals need for a solid brunch. They do make you wait for most of the party to be there before checking in (understandably so).    To start, you walk through the gorgeous main level with beautiful furniture you low key wish was in your apartment. And take the all glass elevator up to the restaurant.    It’s very open, lush and green but not loud or overly hot (like some rooftops). The service was attentive and so friendly. Unfortunately, the food did take a bit of time but who cares when you’re enjoying a Sunday funday? The server gave us a round of drinks to compensate for the wait. So sweet.    The soft scrambled eggs were fabulous and the perfect brunch meal. Pair that with a Bellini and you’ve had yourself a great brunch.    Would highly recommend for a quality and classy brunch.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37669,17,143,American,4,07/30/2022,"Very nice setting. Pretty overrated food though. Though pleasant, the service is fairly slow so be prepared for a leisurely lunch. Bathrooms are immaculate. Patrons are lots of rich people with fancy clothes and cosmetic surgery of all sorts.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37670,18,143,American,5,11/27/2022,"I absolutely love this restaurant. The food was good, but it was typical American fare and nothing to write home about, hence a 4/5 stars. The venue, on the other hand, was just absolutely gorgeous, especially the outdoor seating--on a gorgeous spring, summer or fall evening . The wait staff is also great. The only down side is the bathrooms; however, if you see a line on the main (dining room) floor, you can go down to the lower levels, and you'll find more bathrooms.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37671,19,143,American,4,12/27/2022,What a wonderful venue in the meat packing district. Sitting atop a few floors of furniture display showroom this place has very good food and excellent service.  Just make sure you don't sit facing the sun at lunchtime or you'll go blind. Our hamburgers and steak sandwich were very good. Choco chip dessert was excellent too!,RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37672,20,143,American,3,04/26/2023,"Enjoyable experience. The decor at this venue is exceptional and unique. The chandeliers highlight the special nature of the environment. The atmosphere was very warm and homely. Personally I was disappointed by the lack of veg / vegan options available on the menu. The cheese and baguette as a starter seemed unusual, as the preserve was sickly sweet, and with the addition of the grapes this seemed like more of a dessert than a starter. The salad was average. One of which was quite dry, and another was very sour. Overall, the service experience was positive and efficient. The staff were very friendly. Despite the presentation, I just felt let down by the quality of the food.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37673,21,143,American,5,11/27/2022,"Great ambient, food, and drink!  A must-have is Truffle Fries and RH Bellini!  A reservation is highly recommended during lunchtime.

37674,22,143,American,5,10/28/2022,"Beautiful views from the rooftop, our host greeted us with a smile which made us feel welcomed.    Food was delicious and service was impressive.  Loved the decore and multiple floors of gorgeous furniture.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37675,23,143,American,5,05/26/2022,"We went on last Sunday evening. RH Rooftop is a garden feel interior design restaurant, very unique. Because the weather was cold, we rather stayed indoor. To be honest, the indoor is more beautiful and attractive. We were there for dinner. We arrived around 5. The hostess is cheerful and friendly  Maybe we were with a little kid, so we didn't wait for long time. The menu options are not so special, but there are dishes that look good to order. We ordered  Cheese, Roasted half chicken, Steak, sides Fries and Briccolini. The Roasted chicken is surprisingly good. Juicy, crispy and tender. Steak won't be disappointed. The oval tables are little bit small to put our food (maybe we order too much), but we enjoyed our dinner.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37676,24,143,American,5,05/26/2022,"Get there early so you can get a good spot. The food at any RH Rooftop establishment is ace.

Overall, very elegant and welcoming!",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37677,25,143,American,4,05/26/2022,"Delicious meal along with a bottle of Silver Oak cab to celebrate the hubby’s birthday. Loved the decor—tons of plants and a chandelier above every table. Lobster roll didn’t disappoint, despite other reviews complaining that it’s small. Pictured: shaved ribeye sandwich, crispy artichokes and lobster roll",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37678,26,143,American,5,08/29/2022,"RH NYC serves one of the best Peach Bellini I’ve ever had! You need a reservation which is a bit difficult to get on a short notice but it’s definitely worth it!  The restaurant is on the very top floor, giving an amazing view of the city! I definitely recommend this spot! And it’s very INSTAGRAMABLE if you know what I mean!",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37679,27,143,American,4,01/26/2023,how many times have I been here? 5+  summary: used to be my favorite brunch place. The restaurant is beautiful- make sure check out the RH store downstairs.  service: the hostess was not the most friendly person but the server was helpful and friendly.  would I revisit this place? Yes,RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37680,28,143,American,4,05/26/2022,"This place is excellent for a special date, special event, celebration, and/or just to grab a quick bite to eat. My partner and I went there to celebrate our birthdays and we had a great time. The food is a bit expensive but totally worth it. I must warn you that the portions are big; it is a great place to grab a plate to share with your table. Another surprise for me was just how loud the place could get. The area where we sat was what I would call a ""communal area"" where you share the same bench with another table. If you are lucky, your fellow diners will not interfere with your dinner but you may not be so lucky as it was the case with us where we our fellow diners were three youngsters who had a few too many drinks but overall we enjoyed the visit, the food, and the place. The staff was not very attentive and it took about half an hour or so for us to place the order and another half an hour to 45 minutes to get the food.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37681,29,143,American,4,05/26/2022,"This restaurant is located on the 5th floor of the RH retail store. The space is very impressive with the layout as well as the tastefully curated furniture on display throughout the floors. We sat inside as it is still a bit chilly outside. We all ordered the cheeseburger, side of bacon, truffle fries and chocolate chip cookies for dessert. The cheeseburger was very good and I really loved the truffle parmesan fries. The cookies were served warm so they were just the right amount of gooey. The service could have been more attentive so I can't fully recommend this place as the staff was a bit dismissive.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37682,31,143,American,5,10/28/2022,"The classiest interior- would recommend as ur next date night spot! Overall, yummiest drinks that weren't too heavy.

37683,32,143,American,5,05/26/2022,"Good food in a great space. The service was friendly and efficient. We had shareable starters: fried artichokes and the burrara with grilled bell-peppers. They were both good. I had the rib-eye steak as the main course, which was delicious. The place is on the expensive side, with a $25 corkage fee, but it is well worth the money. I recommend it.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37684,33,143,American,5,09/28/2022,"I must say if you are looking for a bougie, sophisticated brunch, this is the place to be! The lobby had all the beautiful RH furniture which you're allowed to touch, which makes it an even better experience. You take the clear elevators to the rooftop and its an experience like no other. There's indoor/outdoor seating and an exceptional wait staff. I do look forward to going back there next summer with my friends.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave

If you want a beautiful restaurant with great food but want to skip the hustle and bustle of being in the middle of the city, RH is perfect!

Will definitely go again the next time I visit.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave

37687,36,143,American,4,05/26/2022,"I would give it 4.5 but that's not an option. We were sat at a decent time we had a 7:30pm reservation and were sat at 8. The food is tasty but not the best. I wouldn't order the most expensive dish here but everything else was good.  The ambiance is what really sets this place apart from others.

37695,44,143,American,4,06/30/2022,It’s a very well situated rooftop restaurant. Beautiful view and interior. Good selection of wine. Fantastic staff. Attracting a fancy crowd.

37696,45,143,American,5,05/26/2022,Gotta’ go! Get the artichokes and the burrata. The burger was a bit bland but the lobster roll was so good. It highlighted the lobster and it wasn’t hidden in a cream sauce.,RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave

The sandwich was delicious and dipped in the au jus made it succulent and juicy. I will say it was a bit on the rich side, so the entire main might be a lot for some people, however, i devoured my whole meal.    I split the truffle fries with my party, and we were all in awe. They were  some of the best truffle fries that I have had in a very long time and I would go back solely for those. The side sauce for the fries was also tasty.    Delicious.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave

From the warm service to the stunning views to the luxe decor, the vibes were  impeccable .    The quality of the food well surpassed our expectations. We ordered several small dishes to share, and each one was distinctly flavorful and delicious. I would recommend the truffle fries, artichokes, mushrooms, shrimp cocktail, and burrata. The peach bellini was also 10/10.    RH is now my top choice for celebratory occassions!",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37710,59,143,American,4,05/26/2022,Beautiful rooftop space. Friendly attentive service. Table for 6 was more like a table for 4. Expansive wine list with many good options. Apps were good and shareable. Cheese app is a must. Fried artichoke was good. Basic entree choices were a bit boring but qualtiy. Side dishes were generous and good. Excellent chocolate gelato.,RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37711,60,143,American,4,09/28/2022,"Great atmosphere and although the food was a bit pricy, I knew that going in and it was really tasty. The outside area is beautiful although they seem to have a bit of a bee problem right now so we were moved inside after it got a bit ridiculous. Overall would definitely go again, but the prices make it not an every week sort of spot. Perfect for a nice brunch, though!",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37712,61,143,American,4,05/26/2022,"Dining at RH rooftop has been on my list for a while and I finally got a chance to experience a beautiful lunch there! If you’re not familiar, Restoration Hardware is an upscale American home-furnishings company. The restaurant is located in the Meatpacking District and is actually located in the furniture shop. With that being said, you can imagine how beautiful the lobby and entrance is. For lunch, my friend and I split the truffle fries and the avocado toast. Surprisingly, this filled us up because the portion for the avocado toast was basically made for two. We enjoyed a relaxing afternoon and admired the gorgeous decor. This is a great place to visit especially if you want to walk the Highline or go to The Whitney Museum of Art afterwards. *The host wasn't as welcoming as we had hoped for, so that's why I am taking one star off.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37713,62,143,American,4,05/26/2022,"The atmosphere was great, but the servers were not as attentative. The food is also a bit overpriced with small portions. However, everything is beautiful, and it is definitely worth a visit.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37714,64,143,American,5,03/27/2023,"The atmosphere was very beautiful  I'm in love with everything.  it was my husband bday. We got there late but the manager was nice enough to let us in and for that we are very Grateful for that.  The food looks amazing,  taste soooo delicious.  I will definitely be back.  The food is definitely on the pricey side but I see why it is.  Every day has their chandelier. So Gorgeous thou.  We went in the night, nxt time I would to come during the day time to get the experience.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37715,65,143,American,2,06/30/2022,"It was nice to be sitting here during a hot summer day.  The service was kinda rude, weird that we had to wait for our company at the entrance and not at our table.    The food was ok, the burger was a classic cheese burger, the chicken was a bit boring.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37716,66,143,American,4,03/27/2023,"I celebrated my birthday with my friends.  This is a really beautiful place, glass ceiling and windows, green plants decos, music and ambience was all good together.  Food was also good. My salmon sandwich portion was large so I couldn’t finish it. I love their latte. Side dish for the table was pretty good also. And they surprised me with their cookie and candle for my bday celebration. Thank you for that!    The reason I’m giving 4stars not 5 is because, one server was not professional and he kept serving wrong menu. Plus, We found a hair in the food. That hair was obviously not ours but we didn’t say anything. Wish they cared about their sanitary more.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37717,67,143,American,4,05/26/2022,"This is a great rooftop restaurant that has an ambiance for both indoor and outdoor dining. Given, the food is $$$ and portions are smaller however the food is definitely delicious. Ordered the broiled chicken and truly wasn’t disappointed. (Just wish our waiter was a bit more attentive for she only acknowledged us one time the whole meal). Once you’re done with brunch, you can also enjoy walking around and lounging in the other 5 floors and appreciate the great interior design in the building.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave

37719,69,143,American,5,05/26/2022,"Beautiful venue with really good food! You’re paying more for the ambiance and the gorgeous atmosphere. Wait staff is extremely friendly and accommodating    Reservations are available at midnight but sometimes you can lucky when you walk in on last-minute cancelations. If there is a wait, you can walk around the furniture store",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37720,70,143,American,3,05/26/2022,"A little bummed about this place. I had high hopes and was let down a bit. We had reservations, showed up on time, but still had to wait 15 minutes to sit. What’s the point of making a reservation if you still have to wait? They also only serve wine or beer, no cocktails. We were hoping to have some cocktails, but the wine sufficed. The broccolini was a little difficult to cut up. Seemed like maybe it wasn’t cooked all the way (that middle ground between cooked and raw broccoli). The mushrooms and fries were delicious, though. My group did enjoy those bites. I don’t think the charcuterie board is worth the price. They could change it up a few ways to make it better, in my opinion, for the price. Also, we really didn’t like that the server started taking away our food without even asking, and we weren’t even finished eating. I looked to see if there was a time limit, but didn’t see any, so they need to post that for reservations if they do have a time limit. That was very off putting. However, the interior/rooftop is really awesome. It’s quiet enough, even when busy, to enjoy it, but lively enough that it gets the night started. Also, really cool to see the RH gallery throughout the building. I personally think I’d only come back solely for drinks and maybe pre-dinner finger bites, but still do recommend people to try.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave

I had the broiled salmon specialty. Not enough words to describe how delicious it was and perfectly cooked. My GF had the RH burger and loved it. We were accommodated with a cozy table of our choice and not rushed. Angela, our waitress was very gracious and the wines were delicious. Go there. Hope you like it as much as we did!",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave

37727,77,143,American,5,07/30/2022,It was really nice ambience!! I loved how pretty the place was and how surprisingly good the food was. Grilled cheese was ok but ribeye (in picture) was pretty good,RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave

37729,79,143,American,4,05/26/2022,"Great location, great views, nice ambiance and nice decor, which you should expect from the glorified furniture store, simple comfort-food menu ($20 burger and $34 small lobster roll) and adequate cocktail/wine list without crossing the line of being too piggish on the prices for the location. Make sure you reserve a table or butter up the hostess to avoid waiting to be seated. Hopefully the appeal of this joint stands the test of time. Whoever decided a furniture store should go into a restaurant business was either genius or crazy, but whoever implemented this vision was a legitimate professional.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37730,80,143,American,4,05/26/2022,"This was my first time to this rooftop and was one of my favorite experiences. The elevator opens to this beautiful indoor setting with these stunning chandeliers everywhere. There are a couple doors to sit outside one these low couches under a canopy that protected us from the rain that day.    The menu doesn’t have too many options but there is variety and each dish tasted so good!! I started off with a strong cup of cappuccino and burrata for the table. Burrata was very fresh and creamy. We also ordered the avocado toast with balsamic vinaigrette that added a sweetness to the toast, a lobster roll, grilled cheese, and truffle fries. Each food was tasty and it looks heavier than it is!    PS. - make reservations in advance!  PPS - make sure you walk down the stairs and check out each floor! It’s so stunning",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37731,81,143,American,5,05/26/2022,"Another hype location. By unlike many others, this place met the aesthetic hype and the food was surprisingly good.    Ambiance:  Enter the RH showroom and take the glass elevator or the staircase or the elevator in the back. Go to the top floor. There are clear views on the south and east side. One thing - there were little fountains everywhere on the floor so either you’d find it very tranquil and soothing or you’ll find yourself with an unnatural urge to urinate. If you do, the bathroom (near the corner elevators) are beautiful and large for a single occupant. Note that there is one on every floor of the building in the same corner so if you’re in a rush, you can go down a floor or two.    Food:  - fried artichoke  - Prosciutto platter with bread and cheese  - Maple bacon  - Smoked salmon plate  - Lobster roll  - Sliced ribeye sandwich    Of course, fried anything is usually pretty good to start with, but these fried artichoke (flowers?) were light and flavorful. There were a few potato discs tossed in there. And the accompanying creamy dipping sauce was light and flavorful. The bacon was 5 hearty strips of thick cut pork belly, cooked well done with a light drizzle of maple. It was slightly crispy on the outside with a little chew in the center. Amazing. The lobster roll had a very nice amount of meat in a warmed buttery roll. The smoked salmon plate came with hearty sliced sourdough, whipped cream cheese, capers, pickled red onions, and sliced cucumbers, served on a beautiful weathered wooden board. The sliced ribeye sandwich is loaded with a good portion of thinly sliced meat with melted Swiss cheese in a toasted, crusty piece of french bread. It came with a small cup of jus. It also came with a small pickled cherry pepper. The sandwich was loaded with flavor and dipping it into the jus made it explode with flavor.    We went early in the morning and we were amongst the first to arrive. There was a steady stream of diners, many of whom clearly came for the photo op. The service was friendly and attentive, stopping by frequently to check on us. By far, an experience that lived up to the social media hype.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave

37733,83,143,American,5,05/26/2022,"Not just bougie hype! The food and service match the amazing ambiance. You also can’t go wrong with either indoor or outdoor seating on a beautiful day.    For drinks, my friends and I ordered the matcha latte (SO creamy!), peach Bellini (this is a MUST), and jasmine tea (very fragrant). We shared the burrata and truffle fries - both of which I highly recommend! The basil pesto and tomatoes with the burrata were delicious. Many of the dishes come with same great sourdough, so don’t be like us and overstuff yourself with bread before your mains.    They do not skimp on the avocado here. The RH scramble legit came with half an avocado, while the avocado toast was piled crazy high. All perfectly ripe and soft.    I loved the kale Caesar - all the leaves were perfectly dressed. Yes there was a ton of parm but this is still the type of salad with no guilt.    Once you’re done, take the stairs down and admire all the furniture and art. You can also walk out to the patio on each floor for some amazing views of the city.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave

The food was decent but nicely presented and the staff were great. The only issue was that at one point there seemed to be a lot of flies around that ended up landing on my food. I think it was caused by people stepping out on the terrace outside and letting the flies inside. That made me lose my appetite to finish my food. However overall, the experience was great and I would go back again.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave

She was phenomenal! Always made sure we were doing ok and was always available if we had questions. We skipped appetizers and went straight for the entrees. To my delight, the food didn't take too long and was made to perfection (in my opinion). I tried the Shaved ribeye sandwich on garlic bread.    The rooftop laypout is perfect for social distancing.

I wish I could say positive things about the menu and the food. The food and drink menus are very limited. My shaved vegetable salad was good but the chicken was impossible to eat, salty and dry. The shaved ribeye was fatty and tasteless. The Gelato was good.  So make a decision on what is important to you. If you are a foodie look elsewhere.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave

37763,113,143,American,5,05/26/2022,When I walked into the lobby I felt poor. The lobby was immaculate. I immediately straightened up my poster and put on my finest British accent. A kind gentleman informed me reservations are required in which I promptly whipped out my iPhone 10 showing him I cleverly procured an engagement for 10am. The gentleman then showed me the elevator and told me to press 5. I was greeted by a nice warm staff that showed me to my table. The view was good. You could see One World from here. But the food was even better. I had a light brunch of avocado toast and bacon.  The bacon stole the show. Soft and delectable with a hint of syrup. Best $12 I’ve ever spent in my life. I even ate it with a knife and fork to keep up my bougie facade. This is a main girlfriend restaurant. Take your side pieces somewhere else.,RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave

The waitress Rachel was super sweet and very knowledgeable when it came to the menu. I tried the charcuterie and it was delicious the cheese was out of this world. The lobster roll was nice and buttery and flavorful. The drinks kept coming and were really tasty. Cant wait to go back to this place.  A must if you are in New York.

37775,126,143,American,5,05/26/2022,"I was a little nervous about taking the family to a trendy spot, but the crowd at brunch on Sunday is a mix of families, tourists, and trend setters. Our 6 year old and 1.25 year old had a great time and enjoyed their food. Lots of space for strollers as well - which is often not the case in cramped Manhattan restaurants.    Despite eating at 10 am, it was a humid 90 degree Sunday morning. You can feel the heat and humidity on the rooftop. It helps that the seating is spacious and the umbrellas are huge and provide shade…but the inside area is nice and air conditioned and should be considered option #1 on hot summer days.    The service here is top-notch; the staff is extremely pleasant and helpful which makes for a great experience.    As many other reviews recommended, I had the bellini - it’s great! I went with the RH Scramble and got the Summer Truffle upgrade. Summer truffles have a very mild compared to black truffles - I can’t recommend paying the $15 upcharge given the flavor profile barely appears in the scrambled eggs despite the generous addition of truffle shavings.    DEFINITELY get the pork belly - it’s amazing!    I’m looking forward to making a return visit!",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37776,127,143,American,3,12/27/2022,"Food was way too salty and not interesting at all. Service was lacking and the waiters kept bumping into my chair. If they can't help it, maybe put us somewhere other than right next to the water station? After all, there were plenty of seats in other sections. But maybe we got put into an Asian corner of sorts (read some other customer reviews)? Unfortunately I'll never return to find out, because there are other restaurants with nice views and better food and service.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37777,128,143,American,4,02/25/2023,Beautiful space with a see / be seen vibe. Menu more oriented toward lunch but all items were very good.    Wish they had a bar / real liquor license (they have beer / wine only). They won’t seat partial tables so you are stuck hanging around.,RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37778,129,143,American,5,05/26/2021,Pretty brunch spot with delicious food and friendly staffs! Probably one of the best Bellini I’ve had in the city. Arugula salad was on point and lobster roll was delicious. Make sure to reserve a table before you go.,RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37779,130,143,American,4,05/26/2021,"Second visit during the pandemic, October 2020, this one for a lovely lunch. We both had the burger and truffle fries and we loved it. Had a very good Sangiovese wine and we left satisfied. Very friendly and lovely server.    Lovely rooftop for outdoor dinner or drinks during pandemic (and after ). Good service, a little pricey, good precautions, nice distancing.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37780,132,143,American,5,01/26/2023,"Stunning restaurant! Beautiful chandeliers everywhere! We had the most delicious lunch. The crispy artichokes, the grilled cheese, my salad, my husband had the burger and fries. All excellent! We were really looking forward to come here and so glad we did. The washroom also gorgeous, not to mention the beautiful RH furniture below the restaurant. We’ll be back.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37781,133,143,American,2,02/25/2023,"I came here, on a pretty slow night, with high expectations given the good reviews and the status of the restaurant. The ambience was really nice but the food and service were very disappointing. Burrata bread dripping in oil and burnt, lobster roll and shaved ribeye lacking in flavor and greasy. This was mediocre food that you can get pretty much anywhere, and you can make anything taste good if you put that much butter on it. Server looked like he didn’t want to be there, wasn’t friendly and rushed us the whole time. I’m used to having fine dining experience when paying fine dining fare but this wasn’t it! I guess try it because it’s trendy and a nice location but keep you expectations for the food, the bare minimum.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave

37783,135,143,American,4,05/26/2021,The scenery and the service is amazing. Unfortunately I did not enjoy much of the menu. Some things were a bit too salty for me. My drink was pretty good. This is more of a place I would go to after work to kick back with the girls vs a date night out. I however quite enjoyed the lobster roll.,RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave

37786,138,143,American,4,12/27/2022,"I had bruch here. Ordered salmon plate and avocado toast to share with my friend. Portion of the plates were pretty good enough to share and the flavor was satisfying however the restaurant is more on pricy side. If you are looking for a good brunch place focusing on atmosphere, this is a good place, but personally the food is a little over priced considering flavor and other factors.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37787,139,143,American,5,02/25/2023,The food is simply delicious here and the they have a fantastic menu selection too. I recommend trying them out when ever you have a chance. And this place is a great for a fun date night.,RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37788,140,143,American,1,01/26/2023,"We are extremely appalled at our waiter’s behaviour tonight. After we had paid we were waiting in line to use the restroom when he came up to us and asked us if the service was bad and because they supposedly provide good service. I replied no, the service was okay, since he did the bare minimum that a waiter should, like bringing our food to the table and asking if we needed to order something else. Other than that I don’t understand why he said we give good service here, so tips are 15-20% especially since there was absolutely nothing extraordinary  about the service. Tipping is not mandatory and it felt very inappropriate to come up to us and imply that we need to give more money. I can’t begin to fathom someone would have the nerve and lack of shame to beg for more tip in this fashion. The restaurant should include service fees in their menu for their workers’ sake because they apparently feel distressed about customers’ tipping to a point that they need to track them down and ruin their day, while embarrassing not just the customers, but themselves as well. We went to plenty of other restaurants in NYC of similar stature and none of them ever bothered us or gave us any kind of attitude about our supposedly insufficient tipping. Such a shame because the food was amazing to say the least, but because of this incident that isn’t relevant to us anymore and our experience as a whole left us with a bitter taste.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave

In the summertime,  you can go out in the terrace and enjoy the summer breeze.  Dinner was great.  Food was delicious but slightly pricey.  Dessert options is very low and needs improvements.  After dinner you can go downstairs at the bar and enjoy drinks in one of the many awesome couches!  Very casual.  Staff is friendly and is not snobby at all.  Highly recommend this place despite the price and dessert options!",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave

We came here to spend and dealt with the most unprofessional host ever. Would not accommodate for us, 30+ minutes wait when we had a reservation 3 weeks prior.    The waiters were sweet, we came here to have a good time and our bill was over 1k, so we expected a better experience. We won’t be coming back here..",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave

37800,152,143,American,2,04/26/2023,Stunning surroundings but the food is blah. Ordered the gem lettuce salad which was so overdressed it was limp and soggy. Not very fresh at all. The craziest part was paying $18 for salmon on top of the salad and the piece of fish couldn’t be more than 2 ounce portion. Pastis is a no-brainer if you are in this area,RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37801,153,143,American,3,02/25/2023,"Asked for semi private table with a view.  Got seated right next to the check in desk.  Appetizer came with burnt bread.  Shout out to the waitress who saved the experience by comping the apps that were poorly served.  Got a glass of beer 2/3 of the way filled.  Waited to be seated when we were on time with three other parties seated who came AFTER us.  Not blown away, but okay if you want to flex with guests from out of town since the RH furniture show room is part of the experience.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave

Definitely visit here for the ambience and for celebrations but this one is on the expensive side.    Must try: Crispy Artichoke!! This is the first time I had an artichoke this way and they had a tangy touch to the dish which made it delicious. The waiter recommended it for us.    They were kind enough to build us a grilled cheese toast but it was a waste of money! Also the cheese plate was just ok!    It was filled with people though, probably not my kinda place.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave

The service and environment is great! Loved spending time here with some of my friends. Food selection is narrow, but everything looks good. I had a burger and it was delicious .

No golf sneakers and any other would be on the discretion of them. No problem I dressed accordingly. The first thing I saw when stepping out of the elevator was to my right a lady sitting with dirty sneakers. On my left a lady with a sports bar, leggings and a long unbuttoned shirt.

This is the type of place if you don't ask for tap water, you're paying $9 for still bottled water     The food was fine, nothing too exciting, though. We ordered a little bit of everything and shared it. You're paying for the atmosphere more than anything else I feel like.

37848,202,143,American,5,05/26/2022,So my favorite store is RH modern so I loved the decor. The gentleman that checked us in was very pleasant. Our waiter Talon was nice and answered all questions.salmon.. arugula salad ..broccoli .. everything was flavorful. If you can book outside it well worth it.,RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37849,203,143,American,5,05/26/2022,Beautiful place for a date or brunch with friends. Must must make a reservation beforehand! The cheese and tomato salad + bread was soo delicious,RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37850,204,143,American,5,05/27/2019,"The menu at RH Rooftop is small, but the food is great. Reservations are not accepted so you will likely have to wait for a table here, especially on weekends. The burger was wonderful and the espresso/coffee served to us was good as well. This restaurant has lots of natural light, beautiful decor and outdoor seasonal seating. I would recommend coming on a nice day and having a glass of wine outside on the patio. The service was below average, but I'm hoping it was just a fluke. Overall great new spot in Meatpacking and absolutely worth visiting. The venue has chandeliers and greenery all throughout.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37851,205,143,American,5,08/29/2022,"Elegant atmosphere, very courteous staff, excellent, artisanal style food. I highly recommend it.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37852,206,143,American,5,08/29/2022,Exceptional taste in decor  loved the mix of nature and fancy chandeliers all over the place  service was great and extensive menu of wine  …,RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37853,207,143,American,4,05/26/2022,"The design is so beautiful. You go in through the main retail store, take a glass elevator to the top floor where you see chandeliers throughout. Everything is gorgeous from the first moment you step in.    But the food was good , just not great. And the chairs are very low to the floor. So sitting is slightly uncomfortable. But the service was very attentive.    Overall, a good experience. Slightly on the pricey side.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37854,208,143,American,4,05/26/2022,Make reservation 2 weeks in advance! Decent menu. Highly recommend both avocado toast and the lobster roll! Truffle fries is just mediocre though.,RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37855,209,143,American,1,05/26/2022,"As a frequent and local customer of RH, me and my friend were disappointed from the disrespectful attitude of the hostess towards us. I'm giving 1 star because this voice needs to be heard and I hope this makes a statement. Just because you are a busy restaurant with numerous customers coming in nonstop, does not mean you have the right to treat a customer as just another number. After the hostess took us to our table, we kindly reminded her we had made a special request to have a seat at a specific kind of table. She readily dismissed us and said those tables are never for groups of 2 - only for 3 and above. Being a frequent customer, we knew right off the bat she was lying to our face, because we had sat at those tables as a group of 2 nearly 10 times. After my friend brought that up, she quickly responded: ""I am fully commited for the day. I have no available tables. There is nothing I can do.""  Not 10 minutes later, 4 tables opened up, one after the other, and were empty for over an hour as we sat in our table under the sun and had our lunch. Don't get me wrong, the lunch (salad) was delicious. The waitress was phenomenal and very kind. I'm just sorry for the poor management and lack of basic respect and honesty towards the customers.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37856,210,143,American,4,10/28/2022,"The atmosphere is gorgeous and breath taking. Food and drinks was amazing, our waiter was amazing however, the seating area for a party of 6 was too small. Barley any leg room, table was too close to the other group...Felt like we was sitting next to them the entire time and it was terrible to find parking.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37857,211,143,American,5,05/26/2022,The interior aesthetic is gorgeous. Each table has its own chandelier and the arrangements are stunning. The shaved ribeye sandwich was amazing- same with the arugula salad!,RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37858,212,143,American,5,05/26/2022,10/10 this place was so good. Not only was the food amazing but the ambience of the restaurant is so relaxing we ate and enjoyed ourselves for 2 hours I never stayed at a restaurant so long due to not rushing to eat and leave lol will definitely return!,RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37859,213,143,American,4,05/26/2022,"We had a lunch. Burger, fries and coffee. Food was ok but little too salty. A beautiful place but I wish they had more things to show.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37860,214,143,American,3,05/26/2022,The ambiance is spectacular. The food was… medium.  Salmon was too sweet. Not perfectly cooked.    Compared to other west village giants like via carota and da Andrea the salads are not very strong and the mains aren’t as flavorful.,RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37861,215,143,American,3,06/30/2022,"Place is super nice. All the furniture is from RH and top quality.  Food is basic. Just cheeseburgers, sandwiches and salads. Cheeseburger was good but came cold so we had to ask the waiter for a new one hot. Sane with the fries. Entrees don’t come with any side dish, you have to order them separately. Lobster roll was a super small portion. Coffee was too acid:  Waiter was super nice.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37862,216,143,American,4,05/26/2020,Thick cut bacon is the best! Try the white sauce for fries! Special garlic flavor! Signature lobster sandwich is a must try!,RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave

37865,220,143,American,4,05/26/2022,Delicious avocado toast and Gem salad. Great service. Beautiful place. Expensive.,RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave

37868,223,143,American,5,05/26/2021,"Love love love it. Atmosphere, food was great!  But don’t understand why there were so many flashy people were there. Wish the crowd would be more sophisticated people",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37869,224,143,American,4,09/28/2022,Very beautiful atmosphere. Good food as well. But they do not have a cocktail list. So for someone who doesn’t drink wine and was looking forward to cocktails was a bit disappointing but the views made up for that. Cesar salad dressing was a bit too fishy but somewhat tolerable.,RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37870,225,143,American,5,09/28/2022,"As they say, you get what you pay for in life. The ambiance is about as nice as you'll find anywhere. Brunch on a rooftop overlooking NYC? Epic. While the scene there was great, the burger was the best part of the experience. I can honestly say, it was as good as I've had anywhere. I consider myself a real foodie and it was truly mind-blowing.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37871,226,143,American,3,12/27/2022,"I went there on Sunday 12/11/22 and it was beautiful. But I paid $20 for truffle grilled cheese and it did not taste like truffles. The cheese was yellow, but I've only seen white truffle cheese. Someone told me they use regular cheese and sprinkle truffle on it. So disappointed. When you want truffles, you should really deliver truffles.",RH Rooftop Restaurant New York,9 9th Ave
37872,227,143,American,5,05/26/2020,"This is such an incredible restaurant! The food was all incredible and the prices were excellent considering the amazing atmosphere.

38684,0,147,American,5,10/28/2022,"This place was so cool and I will be back every time I'm in town. The music was good, the atmosphere was laid back, the drinks were amazing, the staff are courteous, the food is great. The bank vault aspect is just as cool as the pictures depict, I love how it's sort of sunk underground a bit so it's this unassuming place you can't see from outside, it was such a low-key great place to hang out. I only got lunch (but it was an amazing burger) but I'll be back to try dinner and more cocktails, and that famous steak tartare!",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38685,1,147,American,5,06/30/2022,"This is an amazing piece of history that has been beautifully repurposed. In a former life, this was a huge bank vault! Everything was first rate. The staff was very professional and attentive. All the food we had was exquisite and perfectly prepared. Everything was very well kept and clean. All of their alcoholic drinks were made perfectly and they had a good selection of beers, some from local breweries. I will plan on stopping here often!",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38686,2,147,American,5,05/26/2022,"One of the best place in Manhattan. The staff is very friendly, the service is perfect and the meals and cocktails are absolutely delicious. The portion is big, but it is comfortable and the place has a charming atmosphere. I highly recommend this restaurant.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38687,3,147,American,5,12/27/2022,"Randomly came across this place and was so happy we did.  The espresso martinis were fantastic, our server Brian was awesome, order the tuna tostada, the duck confit risotto, and sage ravioli. You will not be disappointed. Plenty of seating at the bar or a more quiet dining experience in the back. I'll be back.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38688,4,147,American,5,03/27/2023,"Absolutely delicious and very unique! A group of us came here for a terrific lunch during the work week. The restaurant is inside an old vault with these beautiful old doors, and is decorated with a lot of vintage, money related things.    The food was all delicious! It took a while to come out, which was surprising because there weren't many people in the restaurant during lunch, but it was definitely worth the wait. I had the duck leg risotto which was the perfect blend of savory flavors and contrasting textures. The risotto is creamy and smooth but the duck leg was roasted so the skin was amazingly crispy. The portions were generous as well.    Afterwards we got the toffee pudding which was also fantastic, warm and not too sweet. Overall we had a great time here, and would definitely recommend it for lunch!",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38689,5,147,American,5,05/26/2022,"This was our first visit to Trinity and we really enjoyed ourselves! Beautiful venue and very friendly staff. Drinks were well made and food was spectacular. The lady lavender drink was strong but not overpowering, hubby got a scotch that he liked but sadly after the first 2 options were out and the waiter had to go back and forth to check. Was a little surprised the digital menu wasn't updated but we didn't let it bother our night it just delayed the celebration toast! Ahi tuna tacos from the bar-menu were a great app, fresh and tasty! Shepherds pie was served in its own cute ceramic baking dish atop a wooden board with the sald (perfectly dressed with a vinaigrette, shaved carrots and cherry tomatoes) Hubby got the filet with peppercorn sauce and charred broccoli, I was lucky I got in a bit before it was gone!  We enjoyed the music and mood lighting, very cool to walk through the vault doors and learn all about the building and history of that part of the city. Thank you to the staff for being so friendly and accommodating with a late reservation.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38690,6,147,American,5,02/25/2023,"I made a reservation for three Thursday night. From start to finish we enjoyed our time, food, and drinks. Our server Brian was excellent. We’ll be back!",Trinity Place,115 Broadway

We sat at the bar had some small bites from the bar menu and a couple of cocktails. Was a real nice environment!",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38692,9,147,American,5,05/26/2022,Great spot with nice ambiance.. service was excellent.. we ate dou tartar.. tuna tacos..very unique and full of flavor.. cocktails were perfect and the bartender gave us toffee pudding that was a mix of textures.. hot and cold and not too sweet...,Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38693,10,147,American,4,02/25/2023,"After a few minutes searching for the entrance we were able to locate the entrance in the middle of the block on Cedar Street. Once inside we were seated at a table of our choosing. The place had a nice atmosphere but might be a little dark for most people's liking. Our server Andres was relatively new but was very eager and polite. He made a few suggestions which we took and off we went to a very nice evening of tasty appetizers, the portions were not too large, and drinks. The entrees were the right portion for me because I am not a big eater, some may except more for the money. Had cheesecake and tea for dessert which capped off a lovely evening. Andres was very friendly and showed us the way out to conclude our wonderful dining experience.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38694,11,147,American,5,02/25/2023,"We spotted this place one evening as we were walking buy.  The bar was nicely crowded and it looked intriguing.  We made a reservation for dinner for 4 and we were very pleasantly surprised.  This is truly a hidden gem.  The atmosphere was perfect for us..dark, quiet, cozy and we really enjoyed the ambiance.  The wine was excellent and the food was absolutely exquisite.  Between appetizers and dinner we had seven different dishes all of which were excellent. Very well presented and delicious.  I can’t stress enough how  much we enjoyed our experience at The Vault at Trinity Place.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38695,12,147,American,5,04/26/2023,Our bartender (Shawn/Sean?) is so kind and attentive. Highly recommend this place for a happy hour.,Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38696,13,147,American,3,03/27/2023,"Cool ambiance. Food was good, though nothing all that memorable. My steak medallions were cooked fine but could have been seasoned a bit more on the outside. The potatoes were the best part, very tasty. The broccoli rabe was way overcooked so all you got was a taste of the char. Waiter was very nice.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38697,14,147,American,4,04/26/2023,The vibes are great!! They didn’t have a vegan main option on the menu but the waiter was so awesome and was able to quickly recommend a modified soba noodle dish. It was tasty! The cocktails are very good and strong.,Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38698,15,147,American,3,02/25/2023,"Great atmosphere, but food was nothing to write home about. I got the beef rib which were pretty tough and it came with a polenta that was bland. My girlfriend got the duck risotto, it was decent but it didn't have the texture you expect from a well made risotto.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38699,16,147,American,5,12/27/2022,Unique lively bar inside a historic vault. Cozy atmosphere.,Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38700,17,147,American,5,02/25/2023,"Exceptionally wonderful setting to enjoy a private supper. Even though our service was slow, it didn't completely derail our meal. We had the three-course prix-fixe menu during Restaurant Week, and every single course was fantastic! Dessert was unquestionably worthwhile. Drinks…awesome. I have no negative things to say about this location.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38701,18,147,American,3,04/28/2023,"Tuesday,  4/25/23 was my second visit to Trinity Place but, unfortunately, it was a complete disappointment. We ordered the Wagyu burgers well-done. I guess they thought well-done applied to everything including the bun that was toasted so hard it seemed stale. The burger was so overcooked it was as dry as the bun; ketchup did not help as it was like trying to add flavor to a rock. The home fries were also rock hard with the added distaste of being burnt and very salty.    We never complained (maybe because we couldn't believe how bad the food was compared to our first visit) but, it was very hard to get any good service as they seemed to be short-handed due to a larger group seated in the adjacent dining room. Those times when we did grab staff's attention felt like they were somewhat annoyed and rushed.    I do not know why this experience was literally the antithesis of the one we enjoyed the first time (because the first time was actually excellent). It was a shocking shame because we know they are capable of doing better.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway

38703,20,147,American,5,05/26/2021,This was one of  my favorite bars when I was living in New York for four years. Great place and the house is full of history. I don't remember how many liters of Stella Artois flowed down my throat - it was always an enlightenment.  Also the food was great.,Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38704,21,147,American,4,05/26/2020,"friendly, attentive service. lively place with good seating options. cocktails were decent. food was good with very generous portions but not evenly seasoned. primarily under seasoned. need salt and pepper shakers on the table. potatoes with the burger were very hard and extremely crunchy.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38705,22,147,American,5,03/27/2023,"Five of us went for happy hour/dinner and everyone was impressed with their dishes - filet medallions in a cognac cream sauce, boneless short ribs with polenta, Wagyu burger, bangers and mash, and duck confit with risotto. We started with a cheese and charcuterie plate and New England clam chowder, which were also tasty. We sat at booth with chairs in the bar area, which was lively and quite loud. Service was professional (although a bit slow early on with drinks). I’ll definitely return.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38706,23,147,American,5,05/27/2019,"Found this place via Google Maps. Was just look for a nice dinner place. Pictures looked cool and had some great reviews. Lived up to the reviews and then some. Very cool restaurant located in an old vault, dim lights,  very nice. Staff was super friendly and service was excellent. The food was superb. My guest said it was the best chicken she ever had. I had the Duck Con Fit and it was very good. We had a delightful dinner and the best part is the price. It was a great meal well executed at a very reasonable price. Will most definitely return here.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38707,24,147,American,5,05/05/2023,"For serving European'ish cusine I expected bit more class. The service was good but couple weird etiquette mistakes like not bringing wine for tastin before pouring and not pouring wine in front of customer, so I'll never know if the wine I drank was the one I ordered. Also my wine glass was flawed with the stem being unstable and shaky which was weird.  And one weird thing was that we had to eat the entree and appetizers with the same cutlery. We had the cutlery set to 5 o'clock on the plate and the waiter took them off the plate and set them back on the table before taking away the appetizer plates. Of course if we just asked we would have gotten new cutlery but I taught it was selfevident that if the cutlery was set on the empty plate you take them away as well.    But with these minor flaws its still 5 stars for me. I think 4,5 is pretty accurate since the food is good, atmosphere and the theme of the restaurant are great. Coctails are relly good and all the price aren't very high.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38708,25,147,American,3,05/27/2019,My group went here mid afternoon on a Sunday. The only menu available was the brunch menu until 4pm [we were 2 hours early]. The brunch menu was very limited but everything we ordered was flavorful. Everyone was very satisfied with their choices.  The only bad thing about our experience was the service.  We were at our table for too long without drinks and waiting to order new ones. Our server was a nice guy but was unattentive.,Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38709,26,147,American,5,05/26/2020,"It turned out, it is very hard to find a good restaurant open late on Sunday night in lower Manhattan. What's even harder, is to lookup a restaurant you really like, choosing by their pics and reviews. But that's how we found Trinity.  Now, first of all, the place is truly unique due to its style and interior. Try not to take picture of those huge vault safe doors! And all the small details matches the theme so well, like those copper-plated-looking columns between the booths, or those huge 20's-style chandeliers, or even colors of seats and tables along the entire place. I love when someone who creates or designes places like this, has an amazing idea and view of how it all should appear, and then brings it to life in such an outstanding way. Moreover, this style is like wear-resistant, I mean few scratches on a table, shabby leather on some seats may even be adding a bit of charm to it.  Next up is the kitchen, and I have to say, both me and my girlfriend were absolutely happy with what we ordered. I went with Ahi Tuna and Soba Noodle salad, and it was a first time I was trying a chilled pasta dish. At the first bite, it seemed a bit unusual to my mouth, but rightafter I realized how great it goes with seared tuna. And that pepper crust is another nice little touch that needs to be specifically mentioned. In her turn, my gf got Gorgonzola and Ricotta ravioli, and no surprise, she said they were stunning as well. I can tell, the hazelnut sauce they came with, smelled just so good!  Charcuterie board is listed on the menu in a little weird manner. So you have 3 choices - cured meats with olives, pickles and chutney (as we got), then just cheese board, and 2 meats + 2 cheeses combined. First up, it is unclear whether or not I will get olives, pickles and condiments with 2nd or 3rd choices, while the very first one is missing any cheese on it.  The bar selection was quite wide and cocktail list was pretty long too. Beer variety isn't that big, but stylewise - you can find anything you may want. Check out Cucumber Cosmo on the pic down below!  At last, lets talk pricing here. A dinner for two was like $120, which seems a third higher then we could get in local suburban bar; however, considering all I said above, location and amazing service, I can say it is absolutely worth it!",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38710,27,147,American,5,05/27/2019,"Hidden Jewell! Stomach paradise! We had tuna and salmon appetizer, oysters (which were not my greatest), cod stew and Kobe burger. Delicious! Service and ambiance were great. Sticky pudding was not what I expected it to look and taste like. So glad my son ordered it! Must visit again!!!",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38711,28,147,American,5,05/26/2020,So obviously the space itself is very cool.  Giant metal vault doors!  The food and drink were great too.  My cocktail was well balanced and the burrata appetizer was delicious!  I also heartily recommend the onion tart.  Scrumptious!,Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38712,29,147,American,4,05/27/2017,Great spot for lunch. A bit hard to find given the address says Broadway but the entrance is actually off of Cedar.  Huge space and decor is pretty amazing with 2 massive vault doors for decor. Food is also very flavorful. We ordered the Smokies and the Duo Tartares. Fresh and tasty!,Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38713,30,147,American,5,05/27/2019,"I found this gem while searching for a place to take my friend for her bday. It was a Tuesday and very packed but expected considering the neighbourhood so definitely make a reservation if you are planning to go. The bar is in the front which is super noisy but the dinning area is very nice and quite. It was an old bank vault which still have some names on the wall and the big round doors for the vault. I thought it was super cool to have dinner in a bank vault. Food was good, i had the duck confit which was very delicious but not a good presentation. And appitizer was duo tartar of tuna and salmon. This is was very good. I would def reccomend this place for a nice dinner.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38714,31,147,American,4,05/27/2018,Food and service were good. The atmosphere was very cool as it was an old bank. Very quite and comfortable. I had the salmon that was cooked to perfection. Mix green salad was crispy with good dressing.,Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38715,32,147,American,3,05/26/2020,Food was okay  -The clam chowder was not much better than canned stuff.  -Onion tart was probably the highlight of the meal.  -Duck confit was done well  -Burger was standard.    Service was good with reasonable pricing  Do not feel a need to repeat.,Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38716,33,147,American,5,05/26/2022,"Really amazing place to grab an intimate meal. Although our service was slow, it wasn’t enough to ruin our meal.

I would definitely recommend at least trying them out.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38719,36,147,American,5,05/27/2019,Best old fashioned I have ever had.  Atmosphere was excellent. I wasn't squished in with a ton of other people in the area that I was sat. I choose the lamb as I wanted to try something different even though I am not a huge red meat fan and it was terrific.  Best staff I ran into during the entire NYC visit.

We stopped in for a late lunch and we didn’t want to leave because of the warm hospitality, food and drinks. Hakeem was our server and he is hands down the best server!!! Not sure what to order? Drinks - The Golden Hour, Lady Lavender, The Henry. Food: Salmon, The Wagyu Burger, Dessert: New York Style Cheesecake & Hakeem’s favorite: Sticky Toffee Pudding. All of the food was flavorful and served hot.  Later through the evening Marcella came to check on us and she was such a gem . You will enjoy yourself!!!

Bar and restaurant.  after getting down the lobby, you enter through a huge vault door that lead you to the bar where you will find a wide selection of alcohol to stop your thirst. Then you discover a second vault door that lead you to the restaurant.  Warm, good food, good service and all of this for really decent prices.

It's below grade but not a dive; it's in a vault (literally) but it's very friendly. Excellent old fashioned. Best of all, it's not set up to be so loud you can't hear your guests.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway

38736,53,147,American,5,05/27/2019,"Honestly, one of the best meals I've ever bad. It was simple, but INCREDIBLE. The restaurant is stationed in an old bank vault and has large vault doors still intact. The prices are not bad and the decor is beautiful.

One star off for service, but otherwise great",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38745,62,147,American,2,05/27/2019,"Great ambience and food, but service is terrible. The waitress was just lazy and kept pretending to not understand our orders. She would just stand afar and keep repeating that she couldnt hear me. When I raised my voice and clarified the order she frowned.  Anyways then the other waiters would literally throw the dishes instead of placing them on the table, which even made some guests flinch. Tip is mandatory at this place, which I paid 85 usd for a very mediocre service. I recommend this place but don't expect much from their service.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway

My boyfriend has the cheeseburger with blue cheese cooked medium rare and I thought it was good. The appetizers are really tasty- had the pigs in a blanket and tuna tar tar which was delicious. We ended up spending $120 on the bill, with tip added which was great in my opinion for a chill NYC date night.    There are two rooms to eat in; dining room which was more quiet and dark and the bar area which was lighter and louder.

They worked with us through numerous obstacles and the every changing vaccine restrictions in NYC. Even though our 2021 date was less than 3 weeks after their reopening, the staff was on top of their game. They were quick, professional and courteous. The food, as always, was top notch in quality.

The atmosphere reflects the upscale quality of the service and is definitely a bit more formal than the surrounding places to eat in the area...but that’s not necessarily a bad thing.

We had decided last minute to find somewhere interesting to eat and found Trinity Place, I mean.. who wouldn't want to eat in an old bank vault?? Even though we didn't have reservations we were lucky enough to get a table. The food was a.m.a.z.i.n.g. and so were the drinks & deserts. The service was excellent. We live 12 hrs away but if we were in the city again we would definitely be making reservations here again. The manager (we assume manager :) ) was very great!

Having been warmly welcomed and shown to our table by Kimberley we were then welcomed again by our server and offered menus to mull over whilst quenching our thirst on a couple of well earned cold beers. Refreshingly, the menu was not four pages long but concise and tempting. We opted for the Trinity Wagyu Burger with Home Fries and within a very short space of time they were served. The plate was full but not overloaded and beautifully presented. Our server, who we now know is Brian (with an 'i') was attentive but not intrusive. My husband and I were delighted with the meal - it was truly delicious - the burger was very moreish and the home fries were particularly tasty. We followed the meal with the brownie and ice-cream - leave room for this ... you might think you don't want dessert - but believe me - you do!!    The decor is fab. The vault door you pass through before entering the bar which stretches some way back is really unique. The bar is subtly light with dark wood fixtures and a well stocked bar. Unlike a lot of places, music is played low enough to enjoy conversation at your table but still audible when just taking a moment to catch your breath and appreciate your surroundings without having to speak to your companion.    Thanks to those who made our lunch experience such a delight - you know who you are ....",Trinity Place,115 Broadway

The food there is really tasty (the dinner menu, haven't tried the bar). Every dish I've ordered has been good. The pork chop has an insanely delicious sauce; their mashed potatoes are yummy, even their raw fish/japanese style dishes are great. The service is exceptional.

Both where amazing although the lobster meal was quite small. The bank vault is a bit gimmicky for me. But it's a great place. Bit too dark for me too. Great light in the windows from the trees in trinity park. Price was fiat given you're in Manhattan.,Trinity Place,115 Broadway

The waiter was the worst.. never checked on us to make sure the food was ok or to see of we wanted another drink we could have died and he would have never known. The food was even worse then the wait staff!!! We got a melted cheese dish that was recommended by the waiter and it come out like a cheese sandwich. The food lacked any flavor. I would recommend spending your hard earned money somewhere else. This is the worst place ever! If I could give negative stars I would.,Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38797,115,147,American,4,05/27/2018,"Semi-hidden gem at Zuccotti Park. After looking for a spot to have lunch I found Trinity Place!    Very nice atmosphere in an old bank vault. The atmosphere was lively and had a mix of tourists and regular locals.    Ordered the daily soup special, Beef Barley, which I was wondering if it would be too heavy for a warm day. When it was served, it was clearly a lighter version with an almost clear broth and fresh veggies. The soup was enjoyable yet lacked flavor and the serving was very small for $10. This was disappointing for the price.    I ordered Lobster BLT, which in May in NYC sounded good. The arugula salad on the platter was unexpected and the star of the entree. Something was missing in the flavors of the sandwich, not sure I’d order that again.    The ambiance was really nice, so my take away is to enjoy a drink or two and take a break from your day. Perhaps further exploration of the menu is in order.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway

38801,119,147,American,5,05/27/2019,Good food.  Good service.  Lovely decor. Most unusual feature is that it is located in what used to be a vault.  Two of its massive doors are still there and you have to step through them to pass into the eating area.  Very cool and so perfect for a Fidi restaurant.  The website says that this vault was commissioned by Andrew Carnegie and was the biggest in the world when it was built in 1904.,Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38802,120,147,American,5,05/26/2020,"Very neat location, old world NY charm, food amd portions were great. Everything was fresh and prepared carefully. Servers seemed stressed with group service but overall it was a very good experience. Would definitely revisit! Toffee bread pudding was A M A Z I N G!!!",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38803,121,147,American,5,05/27/2018,Old bank vault converted to an upscale bar and restaurant. Good happy hour specials and well made drinks. Food is delicious. Can get little busy during happy hours. Usually busy during lunch and dinner. Dark and elegant ambiance.,Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38804,122,147,American,4,05/26/2020,"This place was great to duck into and get out of the rain. I loved the eggs benedict I got. My wife thought the french toast tasted great but was a little soggy. It didn't bother me, so we swapped plates. I would definitely come here again.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38805,124,147,American,4,05/27/2019,"The food is very good here but service can be lacking at times as they are very busy during the lunch rush. The ambiance is wonderful. I hope they include more vegetarian options in the future, however there is always something I can eat and it never disappoints. Great spot for business lunches.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38806,125,147,American,3,05/26/2020,"Great Atmosphere being in the Vault. Food was average. We had New England Clam Chowder, Pan Seared Organic Salmon and Cod. They were not bad dishes; however, they each seemed to lack something in each one.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38807,126,147,American,4,05/26/2020,We went to Trinity Place for a business lunch.  It was my first time here and i was immediately struck by the interesting decor including the enormous bank vault doors.  The food showed up amazingly quickly which was a blessing.  You don't come here for fancy cuisine but the dishes were well executed and of reasonably large size.,Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38808,127,147,American,5,05/26/2022,"Came here for a birthday dinner date. Outside of minor mishaps, this place was spectacular!! All of the food was amazing and the service was on point!",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38809,128,147,American,5,05/27/2019,"Been here a couple times now over the past 2-3 years and it’s always a solid dinner choice for a nicer date night. Food is good, atmosphere is great, service from hostesses to bussers are kind. The front dining and bar area can get quite rowdy since it seems like they have some group gatherings often but the back table area is totally quiet even then",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38810,129,147,American,5,05/27/2018,Beautiful and interesting space. How often does one have a beer inside a bank vault? Good selection of beers.  We took advantage of $2 off happy hour.  Appropriate music playing on the background. Busy. Vibrant.  A classy place.,Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38811,130,147,American,2,05/27/2019,"This place was meh at best for dinner. It only gets two stars because of the ambiance. I was excited to come here because the place looked cool and menu items looked good but it's all a facade.  We got the short ribs, gnocchi and a glass of wine. The wine was a little sweet for my wife, I didn't mind it, no real issues there except my wife would have liked to taste it before having the full glass.  The short rib was probably the toughest we've had, you actually needed a knife to cut through it. It was rather dry, not a lot of flavor and wasn't that warm. The gnocchi's weren't bad but not great for the price. I didn't get the lobster and they offered to add chicken, which was nice of them. The texture was good but again the flavor was lacking. The service was ok at best. At the end of the meal we probably sat there for 5-10 minutes before they actually gave us the check. Check it out for drinks but skip the dinner.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38812,131,147,American,3,05/27/2019,"The ambience and vibe was really neat considering the antiqueness of the the location and the old bank vaults located in the entrance of the restaurant. My family and I were really excited to order because of its 5 star ratings on google. It took almost 45 minutes to receive our entrees, + the waiter/waitress barely come to check in on us. We waited awhile for our drinks, + when our food was brought out, no one apologized the long wait.  I ordered the potato + herb gnocchi plate which was delicious. My husband loves the filet, but said the sides were a bit bland and very limited in choices. My mom ordered the Caesar salad, + that was OK. Overall, the food was pretty good, but the service was sub par.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38813,132,147,American,1,05/26/2020,"Hospitality & customer service:  poor.  Not all the staff, just some and definitely the manager!    Food & location:  good.    I was truly disappointed in how they treated my partner and I while there.  In fact, we cut our dining experience short because of the manager and went to an Italian restaurant around the corner where we had a wonderful time. I will never eat there again......    Patrick H.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38814,133,147,American,3,05/26/2020,"It's a bit hard to find as the place is not actually on Broadway, the entrance is located on Cedar between Broadway and Trinity. Bar area decor is somewhat cozy but bordering a bit on creepy. Menu has a mix of French and Italian dishes but food is meh at best. Three stars are due to staff being very courteous and accommodating otherwise it'd be none. Not a place I'd visit again though.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38815,134,147,American,5,05/27/2016,"Decor is really dope! Think classic rustic meets upscale atmosphere with low lighting & good music to match. Me, my wife (newly weds), & our mothers came for our reception dinner, which I reserved the day before. They set our table up extremely nice with white covers, candles, & gave us complimentary champagne! I had the fillet mignon & let me tell you.... One of the best steaks I've ever had. Tender, juicy, charred outside, cooked to perfection. Came with cheese scalloped potatoes & Brussels sprouts. Love this place.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38816,135,147,American,5,05/26/2022,Delicious food in a nice cozy environment. My waitress was on top of things and always ready to bring a new drink. I will definitely be coming back!,Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38817,136,147,American,5,05/26/2020,Second best bank vault bar I've ever been to! Also the prices are very reasonable for very good food.,Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38818,137,147,American,2,05/27/2019,"I am a vegetarian and I am gluten intolerant. I had a meal of sides. The best thing was the fingerling potatoes. Most other things were bland. The spinach, I took 2 bites and could not finish it. This place had a nice ambiance with the very unique vault and is probably better for the non vegetarian folks.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38819,138,147,American,4,05/26/2020,"Interesting Pan Seared salmon. It came with a sort of pickled lentil dish that was very tasty. The desserts were pretty good as well. Particularly, the coconut sorbet. My favorite was the bank inspired theme of the place and the ceiling mirrors.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38820,139,147,American,4,05/27/2019,"The food was really good, and I loved the atmosphere. The vault was cool and location was great. I would definitely go back, but hopefully it wouldn't be quite so loud next time! I could barely hear my husband across the table.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38821,140,147,American,3,05/26/2022,Cool vault door.  Otherwise a pretty mediocre restaurant.  Staff was good..food not so much. My daughters ravioli were inedible. Thats hard to do.,Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38822,141,147,American,5,05/27/2019,"This is a great space with a rather delicious menu. Note that there are two major dining areas, the one in the bar area is very loud whereas the one further towards the back, behind the Velvet curtains, is much quieter. This is a great Space 2, for after work drinks or a nice medium priced dinner.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38823,143,147,American,2,05/26/2021,I had the clam chowder which was like warm on the colder side. The salmon was undercooked medium rare. I have never been to a place which gave me rare salmon. They did replace it but it was overcooked. My friend ordered a filet mignon. She ordered it medium rare and it came extremely well done. The only thing that was good was the cheesecake. Pleasant experience eating in a bank vault. But the food was horrible.,Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38824,144,147,American,4,11/27/2022,"This place is real, not like the fake-themed places. Nice atmosphere, good service, good drinks and food.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38825,145,147,American,2,01/26/2023,Gimmicky restaurant for the bank vault entrance but below average food,Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38826,146,147,American,4,05/27/2019,"No frills for after work drinks, and a bar that serves food at the tables, as well as the bar. Table service is available at the front podium with the hostess and a waitress coming around to take orders. Bar service is probably better since there was only one waitress for the whole place. Low key and great for a quick beer.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38827,147,147,American,5,05/27/2018,"Amazing atmosphere,food/drinks and staff. Had dinner after getting married with my mother's and husband! The staff had created a cute layout for just the 4 of us with candles and table decor in a quaint corner! They also treated us to dessert and champagne to celebrate! A must revisit!",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38828,148,147,American,5,05/27/2016,The location is Great for lower Manhattan (Wall Streeters especially). The restaurant is separate from the bar area. The noise from the bar area doesn't carry over to the restaurant. Still the restaurant doesn't feel completely dead either. The food is excellent. The prices are modest. The portions are small. Make sure you thoroughly inquire about the menu items as you may be in for a surprise. I ordered a Steak Tartare thinking of a well done hot steak plate and it appeared to be a cold ground beef mesh with a little half-opened egg shell on the top. Totally grossed me out and I had to forgo. So I ordered a burger instead. Much better. Overall a nice experience. Waitress was kind and considerate.,Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38829,149,147,American,5,05/26/2020,"Stopped in to check this place out last week and liked what I saw.  So today I brought an out of towner in to try it.  Having had a look at the menu, I went with my order in mind. Yes, I wanted the New England clam chowder and the onion tart.  But of course first a cocktail.  Lucky for me bartender Catherine was willing to mix up a drink I had in mind.  I rarely complain about food but when asked I can not lie.  The clam chowder was not at all what I expected having a broth base rather then a creamy thick soup. Not bad, just not what I was looking forward to. So of course, when asked, I said it was not what I had hoped for, as I scrunched up my face and gave the hand sign for so-so. My companion had the Burrata which she gobbled up with joy.  Next, also on the appetizer list I had the onion tart. Even though I was told it was just a slice  and might not be enough, I thought it was plenty and quite yummy.  Like deliciously yummy, flaky crust, cheesy inside with chopped onions so sweet and right.  I could have eaten more, not because it wasn’t enough, but because it was sooooo good!  My companion had the Cuban sandwich and gave it a middling grade.  When the bill came I was not charged for my soup.  This was a surprise since I actually ate it. It wasn’t send back food for being horrible it just wasn’t what I imagined New England clam chowder should be, nor what I had anticipated or hoped for on this windy cold, February NY day.   So, for the bar ambience, excellent service, gracious and friendly, perfect pour cocktails, and delicious tart I’m sticking to 5 stars and planning to return to try some of the entrees.  Thank you Catherine for your kind service!",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38830,150,147,American,3,05/27/2019,"Enter through the unassuming door and venture into this former bank vault transformed into an American restaurant.  Join downtown business people as they lunch with colleagues on a selection of salads, burgers (turkey and beef), and entrees.  A spacious bar and dining room allow you to visit impulsively.  OpenTable participation allows you to make arrangements in advance.  The staff is always pleasant and willing to assist with dietary needs (gluten free).  Prices are consistent with other locations in the neighborhood.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38831,151,147,American,5,05/27/2018,"Love this place, visit whenever I'm in NYC. Speakeasy atmosphere in an old bank vault, good food, good service, good whiskeys and they have the huge single ice cubes.    Awesome people too. Left my jacket there last visit, with my hotel key in the pocket. Was in my hotel room later with new key and got a call to the room phone. Manager Amy got the hotel name from the key and called hotels until she found where I was staying. So I had to go back for a night cap.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38832,152,147,American,5,05/27/2018,"Great location as easy walk from path, subway or even waterway. Amazing to walk through a vault and good drinks and food selection. The cheese platter is lovely. The sitting area is a bit of vintage corner and great for evenings. The service is great.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38833,153,147,American,5,05/26/2020,"Had lunch with my GM and Regional VP, I had the Potato and Leek soup, it was a little thin but was perfect for a lunch starter.  The Cobb Salad was fresh the dressing was flavorful.   Great experience",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38834,154,147,American,5,05/27/2019,Went in for dinner about 9:00 on a solo mission and was treated very well.  Quick and very nice  service.  It was a very active scene!  Had trinity burger and it was served a good medium.  Well run!!,Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38835,155,147,American,5,05/27/2018,"It's a bit upscale for a family with small kids, but eating inside a vault with those beautiful huge vault doors is great! Again, probably not for families mostly in the evening, but it was definitely worth the visit. Food and service were fine.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38836,156,147,American,5,05/27/2019,Trinity is an example of a beautiful transformation of a former bank into an intimate pub that creates an excellent vibe upon entering. The furnishings lend to a welcoming atmosphere after a long day of work.  The staff is exceptional in their eagerness to make your visit a memorable and pleasant experience. I’ve had several late night meals and each plate was cooked exactly how I ordered and delicious.    I can’t reccomend Trinity highly enough. Come here once and you’ll be a regular,Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38837,157,147,American,5,05/28/2014,We had a wonderful experience at Trinity Place!  Have been craving another Kobe burger ever since we were there.  The Sticky Toffee Pudding is awesome.  The owner and bar manager made us feel special. I highly recommend!,Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38838,158,147,American,4,05/27/2018,"Came here for a date.  Good meal, bad date! The food was tasty I thought the customer service was excellent. My only criticism was that I ordered the filet medium rare and it came out medium, but the meal was tasty and delicious, and I did not want to wait for a new meal. I would definitely go back.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38839,159,147,American,2,05/26/2020,Walked in for a late lunch. Not busy but took an extremely long time for everything. We were not greeted and the waitress was unhappy. Had to ask multiple times for our drinks. It was only a brunch menu and took quite a while.  Never got asked if we needed anything.  Very unpleasant  Then watched us taking care of the bill and questioned us,Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38840,160,147,American,4,05/27/2019,"Trinity Place is an island of elegance in the bustle of the Financial District.   Food is tasty and served quickly by efficient waiters.  Wine, beer and whiskeys are all high quality.  Prices are fair.   The decor has dark wood and projects comfort.  Check out the very large vault doors left over from the location's time in the service of finance.    Trinity Place is a good place to go for lunch,  dinner or after work drinks.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38841,161,147,American,5,05/27/2016,"Trinity Place is a super cute bar. The entrance of the bar is a safe door! They have a good drink selection and their bar food is pretty good as well and decently priced. Definitely won't break the bank! There is usually a short wait for a table if you do not make a reservation, but the wait is pretty quick and you can go to the bar while you wait.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38842,162,147,American,4,05/27/2019,"I'm rating this on the bar and the atmosphere, as we just ordered some apps.  Great location, very cool concept that the bar/restaurant is located through an old bank vault.  Needed a few more TVs at the bar and wish there was bigger windows, as you do feel like you're in the basement.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38843,163,147,American,5,05/27/2016,Just dined with my friend whom I have not seen for some time. Perfect choice by luck.... Thought a bank vault would be cool and yes it was but even better was the food. Steak tartare to share for apps then trout for me short ribs for her and topped of with hot chocolate cake. Pretty satisfied right now. I think i have found a new favorite,Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38844,164,147,American,5,05/26/2020,"Definitely one of my favorite restaurants and bars in downtown. This place reminds me a lot of the Capital Grille down the street. That place too used to be a bank. We've been coming to Trinity Place since it opened in 2006-2007. I really dig all the historical pictures posted around the restaurant. I really like the male/female bathroom icons...funny.    I'm not a duck person, but the duck confit with risotto is really good. The Steak Tartare is excellent too. I've had the brick chicken numerous times; you could never go wrong ordering that.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38845,165,147,American,5,05/27/2018,"This is one of the coolest places around. The bank vault is awesome. Had some great cocktails at the bar. The duck we really nice, very flavorful. The bartender was helpful and fun.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38846,167,147,American,5,05/27/2019,A hidden gem of lower Manhattan.  Excellent bar with lots of character and backed up by a flawlessly executed menu.  I recommend the chicken under a brick and the sticky toffee pudding for desert.  There's also a back room that would make a great spot for a small wedding or corporate event.,Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38847,168,147,American,5,05/27/2017,"Food was fantastic!   Such a great night. We had dinner at the bar.  The Bartender was amazing, so nice, attentive...we couldn't have asked for better service.  Definitely recommend for any occasion :)",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38848,169,147,American,3,05/27/2018,This is definitely a restaurant you go to for the atmosphere and not the food. The lobster bisque had a strange flavor to it that did not really taste like lobster bisque. The portions are small and the prices were high what you would expect from a atmosphere focused restaurant in New York City.,Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38849,170,147,American,5,05/26/2022,Cool spot. Good drinks after work. A bit pricey but it's the financial district. I would recommend it if you're in the area.,Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38850,172,147,American,4,05/27/2019,"Great escape for a nice lunch. Walking into the restaurant through The ""vaults"" adds to the interesting vibe. The duck and salmon are delicious. Believe it or not they even had a kids menu :-)",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38851,173,147,American,4,05/27/2019,Really cool bar/pub in the financial district. My wife and I just stopped in for a drink.

38852,174,147,American,3,05/27/2019,"Was quite disappointed, after reading a lot of very positive reviews. The food had some good moments (would recommend the steak tartare for starter) but the duck confit served with risotto could be more accurately billed as a plate of risotto with a piece of duck on the side. The mains arrived less than a minute after finishing the starters which was annoying - maybe some people like that sort of thing though.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38853,175,147,American,4,05/27/2019,"Ambiance and food were wonderful. The service tho was pretty slow at first. We sat at the table, ready to order, and no one came for at least 10 mins. No one even came to take drink orders. And it wasnt terribly busy. Although they were in the middle of shift change so hopefully thats why. Was also seated in a broken chair at first but they were quick and happy to move us. Overall it was a good experience. I would recommend it and would go again",Trinity Place,115 Broadway

38870,193,147,American,3,05/27/2018,New York has too much of great food at affordable prices to waste your time and money to eat here. Food is below average.

Nobody came so I asked an asian lady if we could sit, she said yes, 20 minutes later she offered us drinks, my son asked for a lemonade, we waited for the menu, and waited, and waited.   Finally I went back to the asian lady and asked her if we could get some menus since we were hungry.  ""The restaurant is closed till 5, we only have drinks and bar food.   Aaaaah!!

38875,198,147,American,5,05/27/2018,A truly fun restaurant. It was great eating inside  the doors of a giant vault. The food was exceptional. The wine prices were reasonable which was pleasant and the selection of wines were great.,Trinity Place,115 Broadway
38876,199,147,American,5,05/28/2014,"A quick google search for interesting place to have a drink and a bite to eat this place popped up. The main dining room is in an old bank vault so already its quite fascinating. The drinks are top notch, and the lobster bisque is out of this world.    Fun fact.

38877,200,147,American,4,05/26/2020,"Great spot to stop by as you move from the 9/11 memorial on your way to the Raging bull. This is a beautiful church as well which was closed when I was there in the last week of June 2019, so so check that in case you want to see it. There are many food trucks around for food or even cafes if you are worried about hygiene in the good food trucks. Nice place to spend an afternoon as you visit the crowded downtown Manhattan in New York.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway

Started with a delicious citrusy steak tartare, happy hour special garnache bottle of wine, then on to pasta and short ribs. All were delicious. Service by our server, Zach, was perfectly attentive and friendly! A delicious little piece of New York financial history. P.S. if you want to sit in the dining area, make a reservation. Go after 5 PM so you can order from the full menu, skip the trio of sorbets and instead go for the warm chocolate cake. Oh, and don't expect your check to be cheap.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway

38883,206,147,American,4,05/26/2020,What a different and elegant restaurant. This restaurant was previously an old era bank. It's worth going there just to see the old school vault door. The food was ok and the service was good.,Trinity Place,115 Broadway

Most of the place was given over to a private party, leaving our table crammed into a clamoring overflow crowd. I know from experience it's not usually like this, and the waiter did his best to make up for the chaos. We wish the hostess has warned us.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway

38906,229,147,American,3,05/27/2017,"The cocktails leaned towards the sweet. I knew enough to avoid anything with ""housemade bubblegum vodka"". Instead, I had the ""Other Cocktail"" with ""housemade bathtub gin"", but the orgeat syrup still slanted it towards sweet. The Aviation cocktail was even sweeter.    The establishment is broken into sections with two small pool tables, a stylish bar, a peculiar photo booth, a smoking patio, and a performance area. On Tuesday night, ""Killer Mic Comedy"" was in the performance room. I think we were the only customers that weren't there to tell jokes. It was like dropping into work session where comedians try out material for other stand-up comics. It also felt more like a hang-out rather than a show. There's no cover so it's really hard to complain about entertainment that's free.    There wasn't any parking at the business and the street construction didn't help. Plenty of parking was found in a lot under the power lines a couple blocks behind the building.",Trinity Place,115 Broadway

Who can go wrong with that? :) It's a super cool massive bar and restaurant.  Scene: Very cozy and casual bar. The large open space is conducive to mixing and mingling.

Just got two French Toast with no powder on them and they couldn’t even have the decency to cut the French Toast. And not to mention, they skimped me on one more French Toast. Not worth $10.95.

I barely finished mines and my friend couldn't finish his and I took sole chicken. Who leaves chicken from a salad? No one because there's usually not so much. I wish the restaurant was near me I'd go every week when I'm done work. Definitely going there again when I'm in the area.

The French toast was just done lightly toasted bread! The Greek salad was HORRIBLE! Everything was cut LARGE. It had huge chunks of feta, cucumbers, tomatoes and bell peppers! None of the instructions were followed! The balsamic vinegarette dressing tastes expired. The calamari was undercooked, soggy and just nasty. I stated WELL DONE. This was BARELY COOKED! This entire order is a hazard. Do not order from here. I really wished I checked the reviews. Thank goodness I was able to get a refund. Nothing was edible. I honestly don’t know why they’re still open. Someone needs to buy it and either fire or retrain the entire kitchen staff. This is ridiculous.",Land & Sea Restaurant,20-12 Fair Lawn Ave

Needed more napkins during the meal but there was no one to ask. The hamburger was just ok.,Land & Sea Restaurant,20-12 Fair Lawn Ave

We were seated at a table that wobbled and chairs that felt like they were going to break as you sat down. The table water was disgusting and tasted like metal. The bathroom was so outdated, dilapidated and smelled like a gym locker room. For some crazy reason I ordered salmon with broccoli. There was nothing on the broccoli and it tasted like it was boiled in dirty water. Thinking  the salmon was probably previously frozen, No big deal.. it was raw. Our waitress was sitting at the counter with her back to us so I had to walk it over to her and at least she as well as the hostess were apologetic but the manager never bothered to come over and see if we wanted something else or to at least apologize. My salmon came back and I think it was microwaved. There was no moisture at all! No butter, no spices, nothing. My dinner came with a dessert. We chose apple pie.

46174,10,185,American,1,08/29/2022,"It pains me to say but this place has gone downhill in recent years. The first time I visited was pre-pandemic during a storm. At an hour when other places in the area had closed, the Land & Sea provided a highly-rated dining experience and a cozy shelter from the rain. The food was amazing and the waitresses couldn't have been friendlier. And so I decided to add a new place to my dining list.    However, I have noticed a decline in food quality the past few times I've been here this year. And my dining experience the other night emphasized this. The scrambled eggs I ordered came with soft green particles on the inside- merged into the yolk- and the bacon was highly chewy, despite being overcooked. The pancakes, though, were still pretty good and they provided the only good and edible quality to the meal. It's just a shame as the waitresses were still as friendly as ever, and I couldn't help but feel bad for them through the restaurant's decline and lack of customers in recent months.    I've only ordered breakfast/lunch items while dining here (eggs, wraps, etc), whereas other members in my party have gotten specials and other dinner meals. And I will say that breakfast and lunch seem to be the main categories that this restaurant provided well, despite certain food issues. I can't speak for the management, though I suppose that tacking off the reliance on restaurant-quality meals may assist the quality of its better category options. But for now, since it's the food that's the focus, it's also the food that's keeping me from returning anytime soon.",Land & Sea Restaurant,20-12 Fair Lawn Ave

I guess my dad ate allot, and they just knew him well.  We ate  full dinners and they lasted two days and were really good.  You have to realize, I'm not from Jersey  any more and menu's aren't like novels. You do not get millions of choices.  To have so many choices and make the dishes that well, is pretty impressive.  Plus, as we were leaving, my friend got to chat with the owners son which brought happy memories to him which made the whole evening a win win.

Should have been a clue. Today got the steak, big mistake. Was completely raw. Got the lobster bisque with it (thought, what the hell). The lumps in the bisque I thought might be lobster (even imitation meat would have been okay) were just congeled goop. Veggies were definitely frozen bag, overboiled with no flavor. The place is definitely NOT what it used to be.  To the people who say, 'don't order this, don't order that...it's a diner...' Then they should have specials on their menu.

The clam chowder was Manhattan style and I was looking for New England style. The menu just said clam chowder and I didn’t ask about the type so shame on me.

Peter was the only person I could get on the phone and he was a complete jerk. Continued to call me honey after I asked him not to do so, couldn’t get in touch with his driver, which is of course not his fault, but the place obviously needs more reliable drivers who answer their phone. Promised me a refund which didn’t show up, called back to confirm it was processed, was hung up on twice by a female colleague and was then yelled at by him. Nothing about this was acceptable in any way.",Land & Sea Restaurant,20-12 Fair Lawn Ave
46190,26,185,American,5,05/26/2022,"I really find some of these reviews hilarious. There is an entire sketch on SNL dedicated to how ludicrous it is to order seafood from a diner.    The burgers here are the best in town- juicy, flavorful, and well-seasoned. The breakfasts anytime I've ordered them have been wonderful, and I've been very pleasantly surprised on how good thier greek specials are. I came in very late one night after an event and had a really great spanikopita at midnight. I can't say I'd get that anywhere else. The servers and manager are always kind. If you are looking for great diner food, come here. If you're looking for a Michelin star, the train to Manhattan is just across the street.",Land & Sea Restaurant,20-12 Fair Lawn Ave

But we were hungry and it was getting late so we decided to stay. The hostess was very pleasant and also turned out to be our server. We ordered some basic type food since we were still a bit suspicious. Our food came out and turned out to be delicious. We were pleasantly surprised. I would definitely return. I imagine earlier in the day it's a little busier (how could they stay in business?). Try them  out. You won't be disappointed! Even when no one is there.",Land & Sea Restaurant,20-12 Fair Lawn Ave

My best friend and I were moving and it was already late at night.  We didn't want regular take out so we went with this place. Omg!!

46197,33,185,American,1,05/26/2022,"Everything was wrong. Waffle was sour and missing the fruit. Bagel wasn’t even on a bagel. Waitress was rude, rolled eyes, threw arms up. Brought out the wrong drinks multiple times. Refused to accept it was her fault. 0/10 (if possible) would NOT RECOMMEND. NEVER GOING BACK.",Land & Sea Restaurant,20-12 Fair Lawn Ave
46198,34,185,American,1,05/26/2022,I usually never write bad reviews but this place was awful. I ordered off of grub hub and the food was terrible. I ordered the spinach and artichoke dip with chips and I got no chips. The fettuccini alfredo was incredibly bland it didnt taste like anything at all and there cakes frosting is just powdered sugar mixed with water. Only thing that was good about the food was the ice-cream which is store bought most likely. Dont waste your money!!,Land & Sea Restaurant,20-12 Fair Lawn Ave
46199,35,185,American,5,05/26/2021,"They have a spacious area outside to sit and eat with some plants so that it doesn't feel like a parking lot, But we ate inside because they have a few different areas to eat in so that we weren't sitting next to anyone. The food was really tasty and the prices were reasonable and our waitress was super friendly. Years ago it was the first diner my sister had ever been to and it definitely has many elements of that classic diner aesthetic, but mixed in with a kind of Mediterranean decor.",Land & Sea Restaurant,20-12 Fair Lawn Ave

46206,42,185,American,1,05/27/2019,"Feeling a bit forced into this review.  I’ve ordered from here a few times, usually through Seamless.  One time turkey wrap w Russian, was missing the Russian.  Fine, I save a few cals.  The most recent time, earlier today, I found a pretty sizable bug in one of the containers.  Called the business and submitted a photo to make them aware and process a refund.  Well, they submitted a credit of less than half the order.  It’s not as if I was going to continue eating the meal after I found a bug in it, in fact it’s still in the trash and all of the containers remain mostly untouched.  I didn’t really want to take the time to write a negative review but for the $14 they kept from me I’ll make it my goal to make sure others are aware of the way they conduct business.  Maybe it won’t make a bit of difference, but I would warn you to eat here at your own risk.  I’ll try to add the photo to accompany the review.",Land & Sea Restaurant,20-12 Fair Lawn Ave

I've had it all on that menu and still continue to order their chicken parm, wings, and delicious burgers. Customer for life.",Land & Sea Restaurant,20-12 Fair Lawn Ave
46209,45,185,American,1,05/26/2022,Turkey dinner can only be described as gross. Stuffing was riddled with raisins in some kind of sugary mush. Broccoli wasn’t cooked. Mashed potatoes were flavorless - tasted like stale water.    I think too many food options takes the focus off taste. Would never order again.,Land & Sea Restaurant,20-12 Fair Lawn Ave
46210,46,185,American,5,05/26/2022,Ordered over DoorDash. Had some special instructions on both orders. They  Followed it to a tee. Not that common among diners. We’ll done Land and Sea. Also the food came pretty fast.,Land & Sea Restaurant,20-12 Fair Lawn Ave
46211,47,185,American,5,05/27/2019,"Their burgers are so awesome. And if you like soup, wow! Every variety they offer is a home run. I had the matzoh ball soup and it was perfect.

46214,50,185,American,1,05/27/2019,"Food is mediocre at best. Had two omelettes & they were pretty disappointing, as was the service. The waitress never bought us water & never came to see how we were doing after she bought the food out. Also noticed they sat myself (a Latina) & a group of two African Americans (a separate party) in the back of the diner, while they sat the caucasians upfront.

46216,52,185,American,3,05/26/2021,"Used to come here years ago, so I'll give 3 stars based on my memory of the diner. Walked in today and stood at the counter as the sole occupant for a minute... Not a single employee was to be found. No one in the front of house, no servers, no one. I'm not about to go full Karen, especially because I can't imagine how hard it is to find help right now... But it's even harder to find customers when you don't take care of the ones you still have.",Land & Sea Restaurant,20-12 Fair Lawn Ave
46217,53,185,American,2,05/27/2019,"There was no one in the restaurants and the service was still slow. The waitress forgot our order, And even blamed my medium well Burger as the reason why the food is taking so long to serve.

Lunch on Christmas Eve changed the game though...you absolutely must try the London broil sandwich. It's real, juicy, thick, slices of steak on a bun (rec. Adding mayo)...bliss. don't miss out.

We stopped here because my husband remembered this diner from years ago, and we found ourselves in the area halfway through a long drive. We were unimpressed walking in, but we were with his parents, whose tastes in food are different from ours, which usually makes a diner a safe bet for everyone to find something on the menu, as opposed to trying to find one particulat cuisine that everyone can agree on. After ordering all different dishes mostly from the breakfast selection, waiting endlessly for them (with no word or explanation from our server, or anyone else, on a day when only three other tables had customers) our food came out cold. And we found we could all agree it was mostly inedible. It was such a laughably bad experience that we have made a joke a few times about going back as a punishment.

I took the only train I could find out of Hoboken and got off near the diner and was planning on walking the 3 miles to my house since Uber was a no-go.

(The food did take a while to arrive) but not an issue when you have so many awesome fresh beers to enjoy!! Not only that .. the cocktails aren't too bad either.. the food was on point I really liked the option of adding lettuce tomatoes onions if you wanted them instead of just being served them!! Great touch.. and the beer!! Cold fresh and so many options great for a beer machine like me. But also a good enough selection you don't feel intimidated.. im already looking forward to my next visit.",Rockwells American Restaurant,105 Wolfs Ln
49329,1,204,American,5,06/30/2022,"We visited on a Sunday afternoon and enjoyed every minute of it. As soon as we walked in we were greeted right away.    Atmosphere: I absolutely loved the vibe and atmosphere at this place. It has a very down to earth and ""Cheers"" vibes. This place offers ample amount of seating indoors and outdoors.    Food: My spouse had the cajun burger with a side of onion rings. He was very pleased with both. I decided to go with the steak burrito bowl with rice. My food wasn't bad but it wasn't anything to write home about. We also ordered an appetizer and chose the beef empanadas, they were REALLY good.    Drinks: There is a long list of beers served. There is also a decent amount of tasty cocktails offered. The drink menu definitely doesn't disappoint.    Server: Everyone there seemed very courteous. Our server was Caitlin and she did a phenomenal job. She helped us to feel so comfortable it was as if we'd known her for years. I appreciate her professionalism but also her relaxed attitude.    Overall: We will definitely give this place another go. You definitely get what you pay fo",Rockwells American Restaurant,105 Wolfs Ln

49362,34,204,American,2,05/26/2022,"I thought the staff was very nice to start off with. I ordered a salad and the broccoli had mold on it. The lettuce wasn’t crisp and seemed aged as well. I did not complain and just picked the pieces out that were bad, penicillin is ok. The food is the downside. I tried French Fries they were very hard as if they were out for a while. The fish and chips were soggy on the inside. It just seemed like there products weren’t fresh. I think chefs should be able to see mold and know the freshness of the products they serve. This is very unacceptable and potentially harmful to patrons. I wish you success as this is place is fun. This is to let you know what is going on and hopefully you can fix the issues.",Rockwells American Restaurant,105 Wolfs Ln

Didn’t get the warm and fuzzies, but I take it the clientele are about getting a good simple meal at a fair price and avoiding having to cook it at home. Families, friends and single guys. Not a likely date-spot. Not sure how I feel about being seated downstairs in a darkened corner and near the exit where no other diners were seated throughout our 2 hour dining. There was one table with guests on the other side of the stairs and totally out of view once we were seated. And other guests who were brought down after us were seated on that side of the room also. Not sure what to make of it all, except that it keeps niggling at me. I might go back a second time with a person of color, but only  to see where we are seated.

She ordered a Sangria and I went for Long Island IT. Yea yea yea whatever it was around 1pm but it was one for those days.    The drinks were balanced and delicious.

49391,64,204,American,3,05/26/2020,Service was good but food was bland. I ordered the burger and my friend got the salmon special. The bun on my burger was definitely a store bought bun. The bacon was burnt. And who puts shredded lettuce on burgers anymore? Definitely a disappointment. The salmon wasn’t seasoned very well for the cost of it. But the service was why I’m giving it 3 stars.,Rockwells American Restaurant,105 Wolfs Ln
49392,65,204,American,1,05/27/2017,Great server but the prices for basic diner food was outrageous. The music was way too loud we could barely hear our server.

49393,66,204,American,5,05/26/2020,Everything is really affordable.  This was my second d time there and it's nice. I appreciate the downstairs sections more as it's a bit more private. They also have a comedy night which is pretty cool. You would think they will serve small plates but no the plates are kind of over sized. Try the apple crumb cake with icecream on top its delish! The service is excellent as well. The only bad thing there is the size of the bathroom but who really cares about that!,Rockwells American Restaurant,105 Wolfs Ln

I was hungry after my flight from LA and she brought me breadsticks to munch on. Doesn't sound like much but was enough to get me through the night.  I would definitely recommend this  place.,Rockwells American Restaurant,105 Wolfs Ln
49403,76,204,American,4,05/27/2018,The food is good and if it's your birthday you get a free waffle sundae. The comedy nights are hit and miss.

49408,81,204,American,3,05/27/2019,"We've only been there a couple of times, and it's been hit or miss. Our first experience was a random Saturday lunch and my wife and I really liked everything -- especially the desserts. Our second experience was a casual dinner on Christmas day and  unfortunately everything we ordered was terrible. Some things even seemed spoiled. The place was unusually empty and we suspect that the regular chef / cooks must not have been working because it was a holiday. Nothing tasted like it had previously, and several dishes were absolutely vile. We will likely give Rockwells one more try before writing it off our list, because a lot of people seem to love it.",Rockwells American Restaurant,105 Wolfs Ln
49409,82,204,American,2,05/27/2019,"Overpriced pub food. Don't know why I've given it so many chances. Ordered take out recently. $40 for a salad, wings and fries. And they forgot the fries.

49413,86,204,American,5,05/27/2019,Love Rockwells! My favorite is the fried dijon chicken panini with either sweet potato fries or onion rings.

I don’t like people from Colorado, they get to smoke all the dope they want is what the OWNER said after my ID was deemed invalid by a waiter even after their unofficial ID verification app said it was indeed VALID. Then he calls the police. Once the police officer pulls back up the cop asks for my ID and then called in to verify it because if it wasn’t valid he was going to take it.

They were very accommodating, we purchased a cake for my husband and bought it with us. Coming to the end of the night they bought out his cake with sparklers on it, nice touch. Drinks were drinks then we're not holding back on the alcohol and the food was very good. My overall take on rockwells is 10 out of 10.  We were also there for the comedy show which I felt would have been hit or miss and it was definitely a hit all three Comics were funny the headliner was hysterical.

49441,116,204,American,1,05/27/2017,"I deeply regret having been an enthusiastic patron of this place for over two years. I have never written a negative review but what happened last night is disgraceful and contemptable, and we will certainly never set foot in this joint again (I highly recommend Yonkers Brewery Co. as an alternative).  We have been to this place almost once a week, sometime twice for a long time, know all the waiters on a first name basis (and vice-versa), but we had never attended the weekly comedy night, in the lower ground dining room. Just in the last 7 days we had eaten in the bar room twice. Still we were happy to go again last night invited by friends for dinner and comedy. The first number was fine with raunchy chats between the performer and the audience. The second number was more painful, and it did not seem to be amusing from the start. The funnyman called on me for looking too serious, and suggested that I would laugh before his sketch was over. Then he went on with very sorry lines straight out of a Fox news storybook about the legitimacy of the presidency, and the illegitimate alternative choice in the election. I commented twice that ‘this is not funny!. As he continued on the same theme, we turned to our hosts and apologized that we had enough of it and were going home. Then we headed upstairs to leave the place. We did not think much of the situation, except that it was really bad comedy. What happened next is totally scandalous.  The owner of the place confronted us by the exit door, refused to let us leave, and told us in front of the packed main dining room, that a) we were not welcome to come back, and b) we had to pay before leaving the premises. When we explained that our friends would be paying the bill, he threatened to call the cops. We suggested that indeed he might just do that, but as we did not want to embarrass our hosts, and create more commotion, we paid what looked like the full diner bill. I did comment that he might have got a better tip from our friends. LOL",Rockwells American Restaurant,105 Wolfs Ln

The staff was really on top of things to make sure everyone's needs were met and the food was delicious. They even made more to our buffet when they saw things were getting low as well as throwing in 2 veggie burgers for the vegetarians in our group.

They gave a variety of beads including Irish soda bread that was almost as good as Grandma Flanagan's. They gave me a steak knife with the lamb shanks but I really didn't need it. The meat just fell off the bone. So much mashed potatoes I couldn't finish it all. Plenty of butter melted on top. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.,Canlon's,1825 N Railroad Ave

I've had the filet mignon, stuff shrimp, and a burger on different occasions. The staffs super friendly, and the atmosphere is super laid back. There's two party rooms for large groups and events, separate from the main dining room, enabling people that aren't apart of a party to still get a good meal and service.

62546,30,287,American,2,05/27/2017,"Staff was nice, but very young. I ordered the Veal Parmigiano, it was okay, but nothing to boast about. When it came to pay, they charged my card twice, instead of my card and my friends card. The issue was corrected, but still annoying nevertheless. Overall, I don't think I'll be going back. This is, of course, my own opinion from my own experience, if you do go, your experience may differ.",Canlon's,1825 N Railroad Ave
62547,31,287,American,1,05/26/2020,"Place was not very clean. The menus were sticky and the silverware was smudged. The bread on the table was hard enough to break teeth. Two of my friends ate the same dish and got food poisoning immediately (Penne a la Vodka with Chicken).  The servers were very nice but their actual service  was just okay. The food was okay. Menu was confusing. If you have allergies, I DO NOT reccommend you go here. I reacted just to a baked a potato when I have a shelfish allergy. So please be careful.",Canlon's,1825 N Railroad Ave

62567,51,287,American,1,05/27/2019,"Stay far away from this place.  Called in January to book for my daughter's shower in June, was told to come in and speak to the manager, when I get there the only person helping me is a 16 year old waitress.  She told me I could leave a deposit and she'll write it in the book, and hands me 2 luncheon menus and told me that was the price.  I felt uneasy so I did not book right away.  I went back three other times because I liked the room but never got anyone but the waitresses to book the room and no contract.  They told me that I could choose from one of the luncheon packages, even bereavement because it was a Saturday afternoon party.  I gave a check, they wrote it in the book and I sent out my invites.  I recommended this place to my sister that was having a party because the price was reasonable, when she called she was quoted a price $20 more than what I thought I was getting.  I called the restaurant and again got a young person to speak to, I told them I was told that I was getting the price that was listed on the menus given to me, and they said no we can't do that.  I then asked to speak to someone in charge, they put the owner on.  The owner immediately had a hostile attitude and told me he would absolutely not do the price that I was quoted and no cake included either, I said I've been there 4 times and told the same thing every time I went there, he said who doesn't get a contract when their having a party? And I said I tried but you have children taking care of your party bookings.  He then said to me, what do you want me to do about it?  Very arrogantly like he could care less, I told him that I was not happy about this and he said then come in and get your money back, I told him I already sent out my invites and he said and I quote, ""then you better zip your mouth or I won't help you""  I was absolutely furious!!!!!  I said how dare you speak to me that way, and he said and I quote, ""I've been in business for 30 years, I don't need you"".  He then hung up on me.  Being a mom and putting my daughter first I called back because I didn't want to ruin my daughter's shower, I was then given a price that he would agree to and I said I need that in writing and emailed to me, he said no.  He then said and I quote ""I'm a dinosaur and I don't do email, if you want a contract you will have to call and make an appointment with me and come down and get it.""  This is the same man that comes by and greets everyone with a smile and shakes everyone's hand when you go there.  Don't be fooled by this arrogant jerk.  Do not book any parties with this place, they are unreputable and insulting!!!!!!!  I hope everyone that reads this beware!!!!!!!!",Canlon's,1825 N Railroad Ave
