23291,42,69,Italian,1,05/19/2020,"Food was not bad.  Could have provided larger portions all around considering the prices.  Now for the reason to not go:  SERVICE - Trying to ask a question, no one to be found, yet there were 10 or more waiters.  Trying to get a drink, takes one drink order, there were 4 of us and the other 3 had to wait until the waiter returned.  Placing an appetizer order and placing a dinner order, forgettaboutit!!  You are waiting!!  Did I say there were 10 plus waiters in the restaurant.  Try asking a question, exactly, try asking a question.  Oh, I forgot, ONE bartender(it was a Friday night), very nice young lady, but there is no way you should have one bartender behind the bar handling table and bar orders on a Friday night.  BTW Manager made pretend he cared when these issues we brought to his attention.  My recommendation:  Skip this place.  The star above is because I could rate it -5!!",Arno,141 W 38th St
57629,8,248,Italian,4,12/27/2022,Nice atmosphere & delicious food.  You have to try the Santa Mule while it's available!!!,Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave
22399,47,66,Italian,2,05/19/2022,"Food was great, even pasta was not al dente.  Also some salt in the pasta was missing but maybe because I was born and raised in Italy so these people probably don't know exactly how authentic italian food can taste.  But it was good overall.  Meat was great and artichokes were fantastic.  Food came quickly. Bussers were nice and professional.  Unfortunately Eduardo ( or Edward) ,our waiter , wasn't good at all. He had an attitude, he rolled his eyes more than once to us which is totally not acceptable from a waiter who is serving food to a customer but we tried to ignore him. The dude really hates his job  you can tell ,  so that ruined the experience a bit.  The rest of the waiters seemed nice.  Good food overall but it's really huge quantity. Not sure I would repeat.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
13079,0,33,Italian,5,08/22/2022,"The starter is great. The sweetness of tomato is perfectly balanced by prosciutto, held together by the Motorola cheese and fresh basil. The balsamic vinegar then adds a light good flavor. Home made bread had a good texture, not too hard not too soft. We ordered a seafood pasta with a bolognese as the side. Surprisingly, The side spaghetti comes as a full size. Good background music. Highly recommended!",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13080,1,33,Italian,5,05/19/2022,"Specials are nicely prepared.Pasta is homemade. Had a very tasty Rib eye steak, temp was spot on.  Friendly service and attentive. The homemade wine is very good. Will be back again soon.",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13081,2,33,Italian,5,05/19/2022,"My wife and I decided to forego Manhattan and stay local in queens. To our surprise this gem was hidden in Corona. The decor was a little rustic but but lovely. The restaurant appeared clean, friendly staff and nice music. The homemade wine and bread were very tasty. Perfect setting for a date night or family dinner. I would recommend this restaurant.    If I had to knit-pick- may be the bread could have been toasted (I assume it’s possible on request).",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13082,4,33,Italian,4,12/20/2022,"The seafood fetucini was delicious, the alfredo was on the bland side. The baked clam was salty, and the best one we ordered was the chicken with broccoli. The food took too long to come out.",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13083,5,33,Italian,5,09/21/2022,"We’ve always been loyal to Parkside, but the service has gone downhill in the past years, and so we wanted to try somewhere new. We tried Il Triangolo after seeing the positive reviews online, and the reviews do not do it justice. The staff was friendly and attentive, the calamari appetizer was delicious and HUGE (there were just two of us eating dinner), and we shared the fettuccine Alfredo and the gnocchi with ragu sauce. Both were worth the wait, as they were prepared intentionally and deliciously. We savored over every bite until we couldn’t eat another bite. Il Triangolo will be a definite must on our list now on!",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13084,6,33,Italian,5,05/19/2022,"I am so glad they opened Il Triangolo back up. Classsic Italian restaurant in the heart of Corona, Queens.    What are they known for? In my opinion, their homemade meat sauce is to die for. I ordered the chicken Marsala, and lemme tell you, most Marsala I’ve had is salty, but Il Triangolo got it right. Hint of the red wine, along with well cooked tender chicken and three types of mushrooms.    Wife ordered the Fruitti di Mare, the seafood was fresh, the pasta almost al dente. Very well cooked.    Staff was friendly and they really do treat you like a long lost friend. Do I recommend it? There’s a reason why they got 5-stars from me.    Try it once, I can guarantee you’ll go back again.",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13085,7,33,Italian,4,07/23/2022,"Food was good but some items on the menu were overpriced. service was slow, there was only one waitress on at the time, no music at all. Not what I expected.",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13086,8,33,Italian,2,04/19/2023,"Beware of the filet Mignon when it's really a deep fried pork chop. Service is good but misleading.  Pasta was not freshly made like we were told. Carafe of sangria is $48. On top of that I threw up from spoiled food, my son in law had diarrhea and my girlfriend threw up after eating leftovers next day. I can't believe this, never had this before.",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13087,9,33,Italian,2,03/20/2023,"We came on Friday night,the place was empty!we wanted seafood platter that is on their website menu,but they said they don’t have it!not the greatest food(I mean veal grappa served with hard broccoli not that great combination)!baked clams were ok,but nothing special!Italian draft beer tasteless!You can find much better Italian restaurants with better food!I mean it’s totally not worth $270 that we left there!  P.S.And those small white plates are really old and scratched,time to change it for newer!Thanks,anyway!",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13088,10,33,Italian,5,05/19/2022,"Delicious Food!  A classic Italian restaurant that, food and service are all excellent. Make sure you ask for shrimp tapas and the classic carbonara pasta, OMG  delicious! very juicy and full of flavor. It’s impressive that everything are homemade (bread, sauce, pasta and the bacon is also prepared there) they also have gluten free and wheat pasta as part of the menu. Excelente wine list ask for  advice/suggestion to pair the right wine with you dish. Place is lovely, clean,  friendly staff, great service, great food. Really good restaurant thoroughly recommend.",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13089,11,33,Italian,5,12/20/2022,Our second time here. The ambiance is lovely and the service immaculate. Julio took wonderful care of us. I enjoyed my plate of spaghetti with two heaping meatballs. Portions are very generous.,Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13090,13,33,Italian,5,05/19/2020,Beautifully and deliciously prepared homemade Italian food. Loved everything from start to finish. I also love that everything is homemade. I’ve lived in Elmhurst my entire life and had no idea this restaurant was such a gem. I highly recommend you go. Dress nicely and put away your phone. Very friendly and hospitable.,Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13091,14,33,Italian,5,05/19/2020,"Went to Il Triangolo with friends and had a very nice dinner. We were greeted by Mario, the owner, who came to our table and shook our hands, a very nice touch. Mario also very patiently took our orders. They brought out a very nice bread dish with fantastic chopped olives. We starters we had a delicious stuffed calamari that was so good. I had the fish special. Orata (spelling?), a white fish cooked with a baked clam like topping, I chose wisely as it was great. My wife had the veal chop special that was very good. Both entrees were accompanied by homemade spaghetti. We ended the meal with a great chocolate cake that was very much like a black forest cake. Overall it was a great restaurant and I highly recommend it. The service could not have been better and I wish I could give it an additional star.",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13092,15,33,Italian,5,05/19/2021,"Still the same quality since re-opening and new ownership.    I ordered the DRY AGED RIBEYE cooked to medium with baby potatoes and broccoli rabe and the STUFFED PEPPER both from the specials that day.    The steak was cooked exactly as requested and was delicious. I was a bit skeptical ordering a steak in an upscale Italian restaurant as I usually order a pasta dish but no regrets.    The stuffed pepper appetizer is plenty for 2 people. RED PEPPER STUFFED WITH CRAB, RISOTTO AND TOPPED WITH GORGANZOLA CHEESE. IT WAS INCREDIBLE.    We do miss Mario but as I said still running like clockwork and will continue to go back.",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13093,16,33,Italian,4,05/19/2020,"I couldn’t of picked a better restaurant in Queens for my sister’s birthday!  The service and the atmosphere was phenomenal!  This restaurant has class!  No Cel phones are allowed only for pictures!  Put your Cel phone away in your purse while dining here, and ringers must be turned off.  Men need to be is collared shirts.  Coats must be checked in and not hung behind your chair.  We all felt like we escaped to Italy for a few hours while dining here.  They timed perfectly from when appetizers, dinners, and desserts came out plus they gave us as much time as we wanted to enjoy our time there.  There was no rush on getting us out.  I highly recommend this restaurant for any special occasion or just a romantic dinner!  For appetizers we ordered two half orders of the homemade ravioli and the Mediterranean salad.  The appetizers were very good!  For entrees two of us had the prime rib eye steak, and I had the spaghetti with chicken meatballs.  The prime rib eye steak was seasoned and cooked perfectly!  It had a great charcoal flavor as well.  The spaghetti and meatballs were good, but I was expecting the sauce to be more flavorful.  The chicken meatballs were ok/good, but I’ve had better.  The next time I go I’ll try something different.  It’s the only reason why I’m giving 4 stars instead of 5.  For desserts we had the apple crostata cake, ricotta cheesecake, and the cannoli all were so good!  We all really wanted to order a chocolate dessert to finish our meal, but none were available that day.  They also give you house made biscotti with dessert which was excellent!  They truly made my sister’s birthday extra special, and we are looking forward to dining here again.  I highly recommend dining at Il Triangolo in Corona, Queens!",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13094,17,33,Italian,2,03/20/2023,"The food and dining experience was really mediocre. We waited over 45 mins for our mains to come out and when it did come out, the taste was very disatisfying. My porkchop tasted like a chicken parm from a college dining hall drenched in sauce, and my spaghetti tasted like the leftover spaghetti you reheat with jar sauce poured on top.    My boyfriend ordered veal and I can't even describe how unpleasant the texture was for his sides and how overcooked the veal was.    Not sure why it was rated this high tbh...",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13095,19,33,Italian,5,11/20/2022,"Really good food, I liked both the risotto and the veal polenta. The waiter was attentive and chatty, but also gave us space and time for the after dinner. The restaurant has a nice old fashioned vibe.    The specials on the menu all look very interesting and I'd love to try more of them.",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13096,20,33,Italian,4,07/23/2022,Good Italian food. Only 1 server. It was not busy on a Friday night. Food was delicious though,Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13097,21,33,Italian,5,08/22/2022,Great authentic Italian food. The owner and staff were very friendly and nice!    Almost Everything is homemade here which is great.    Highly recommend the seafood pasta and Bolognese.,Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13098,22,33,Italian,5,05/20/2018,"Love the no phone policy, really makes you seem as if a traditional family dinner at the table. Superb service, and the food just OMG this is definitely worth the cost. Very friendly service. If Italian food is your thing, THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO TO!!!!",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13099,23,33,Italian,5,05/20/2019,Unbelievable meal with amazing service. This place might be the best restaurant in New York. The veal alla grappa and fettuccine alla triangolo are two must haves. I truly felt like I was in someone's hi sue having a dinner. Make sure Friday and Saturday nights you dress to impress or you won't be seated.,Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13100,24,33,Italian,1,08/22/2022,"First and last time we’re ordering or eating from this place.  My daughter has allergies and we specifically ordered without cheese and they put cheese on the pasta. The veal Mario style…in the description it says it has bacon, peas and tomatoes, well is had bacon, Lima beans and broccoli (raw). This dish was tasteless and a bunch of thyme on it…AWFULLLLL!  The price is $25.00, it’s not even worth $10.00. The chicken scallopini…was a chicken breast grilled with lemon juice on it and a couple of raw broccoli florets thrown on it…totally tasteless!  I’d say the only thing this restaurant can make is penne a La vodka. NEVER AGAIN!! Don’t waste your money, stay away from this place.",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13101,25,33,Italian,5,05/19/2022,"The first time i went in i thought it was a cute little place. Cozy and quaint. I read the sign with rules and i liked it. Phones on vibrate, no caps , hoods and all phone calls taken outside.  The original owner Mario hit pay dirt marrying an amazing chef. Everything is fresh and made in house. From house made wine , everything in between, to all the desserts are made in house. Not bought from bakeries. Yes even the bread!!!  When Mario and his wife retired i was reluctantly debating to return to this restaurant. To my surprise, this new husband and wife team knocked it out of the park. Sticking to the standards set forth by the previous owner and raising the bar to a new level. I strongly suggest you come hungry. It will not disappoint you. My personal favorite is a pan fried chicken sorrentino for a main dish , fried calamari and definitely need to have the Black linguine!!!!!! To die for!!!!",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13102,26,33,Italian,5,05/19/2022,"I loved to come to this Italian restaurant before the pandemic. It was very homey and classy (but not too fancy for the sake of being fancy). The food was always delicious, and the atmosphere was top-notch as well. It was my go-to spot for dates. I can't wait for my next reservation, and hope the Mario family is doing great too. So glad to know it is reopened.",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13103,27,33,Italian,5,08/22/2022,"Let me start by saying I’m not a fan of Italian food. Even so, I loved this place! The gravy was the best I ever had. The veal parmigiana along with everything else brought me as close as I’ve ever been to enjoying Italian food. This place is old New York that sadly you don’t see much anymore. Enjoy it and try it out",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13104,29,33,Italian,5,09/21/2022,"This is a great little restaurant and one of my favorites. The food is always very good, the atmosphere is nice and the owner and the wait staff make you feel very welcome. This is one of those small gems that make NYC unique and worth being here.",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13105,30,33,Italian,5,08/22/2022,"Julio, the waiter, was amazing. Elisa too.",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13106,31,33,Italian,5,05/19/2022,"Celebrated my husband's 65th birthday last night.  We were a party of 15.  Food and service were top notch.  Everything was so fresh.  We had it all, pasta, rib eyes, pork and fish absolutely delicious.  If you're a lover of baked class, this is the place.  All pastas made fresh, excellent.  Huge shout out to Julio who took care of us, he was fabulous. We will certainly go back back!!!!!",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13107,32,33,Italian,5,05/20/2019,The food is awesome and their service is fantastic. Always enjoy going to this restaurant.,Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.

13110,35,33,Italian,5,05/19/2020,Great classic Italian food. Everything is home made.,Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13111,36,33,Italian,1,08/22/2022,"I would do 0 stars if I could, but I can't so I will warn you about this place. I very rarely write bad reviews but this place was so horrible on all fronts. The atmosphere, the food, and the service were all exceptionally poor. I will break down each category below:    Atmosphere: Don't head here for a romantic Italian dinner unless you want to listen to salsa music and snappy waiters.    Food:    The sopresseta was average at best and there were multiple inedible pieces of meat in the sauce.    The signature dish ""Chicken Frangelico"" tastes like sweet and sour chicken with soggy bacon on it.    Service: WORST OF ALL my partner booked 3 weeks in advance for a table in the backroom and they lost our reservation. Someone had a wonderful idea to put a table for two directly next to the kitchen door. This is a great experience if you want to feel like you are working in a kitchen on your valentines day weekend.    Our servers switched in the first 5 minutes, we  ordered and the food came out and they never checked in again.    I asked they take the food away and for the check.    THEN WE WERE HELD HOSTAGE FOR 20 MINUTES BECAUSE THEY TOOK SO LONG TO BRING THE CHECK.    It is torture to be stuck in a restaurant were everything is bad and we can't even get out.    Here is your warning, don't go here. There are plenty of Italian places in New York and this is one you don't need to visit    Edit: the owner replied. My response    Heads up dude. If no one wants to serve at your restaurant it is because your pay is bad. No one wants to work anymore is a cop out. No one wants to work at your restaurant anymore. Post a higher wage and I'm sure you would find someone. There are plenty of well staffed restaurants in NYC. How come they are staffed well?    People request to sit next to the kitchen door? Lol    Also, we were 20 minutes early. Why are you even lying? Your response just shows that there is no hope in your restaurant improving. Making excuses and not taking ownership of a poor experience is the hallmark of poor management.    I wouldn't go back if you paid me.",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13112,37,33,Italian,3,08/22/2022,"Bread was stale, asked for new and it was fairly bland, not much flavor. Ordered the special chicken cacciatore, it was okay but missing something, perhaps the wine. After dinner the server asked me to tip him in cash, not sure what that was about but it was strange.",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13113,38,33,Italian,1,12/20/2022,"The pasta was dry and the salt didn’t even help  the service was bad, they took for ever more than a hour  wasted slot of money just for it to be dry, no taste",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13114,39,33,Italian,2,03/20/2023,Parkside I would recommend or Louie’s on Baxter for some nice pasta.  This was ehhh. Got me once,Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13115,40,33,Italian,5,05/19/2020,"Amazing! The owner was very hands on and in a good way. Homemade pasta, can't go wrong.",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13116,42,33,Italian,5,05/19/2022,"This place is the ABSOLUTE BEST and it lacks in not 1 thing. The staff is SUPER friendly attentive and helpful. The restaurant feels like home, is beautifully decorated and has everything you need to make you feel comfortable and know that your stomach is about the get the best food ever.    Food is cooked super fresh and i mean the ingredients are on point and perfect. Big portions, seasoned to ABSOLUTE PERFECTION. DO NOT HESITATE AND I MEAN DO NOT. Take that chance, check them out and you’ll wish you found this place Sooner!!!    P.s. the tiramisu is a killer and i mean it’s fire",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13117,43,33,Italian,5,05/20/2019,"Absolutely phenomenal experience!!! I  can't say enough about the food, the service, the atmosphere! Everything was spectacular! The owner, Mario, personally greets you and takes your order! The wait staff all wear suits not cheap uniforms; and they are so attentive. I dropped my fork on the floor and by the time I reached down to pick it up the waiter was there with a clean one on a silver platter to replace it. The entire restaurant is clean and neat (and decorated for Christmas). The homemade wine, pasta and desserts were delicious. They even spaced out the appetizers so we didn't ""mix the flavors"" and were fully able to enjoy each dish. This was our 3rd time here and it was just as awesome as the first. The highest recommendation possible!",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13118,44,33,Italian,5,05/20/2018,This was my first time going to this restaurant and it will definitely not be my last. It was one of the most relaxing enjoyable meals with some of the best food I've had in a long time. Comfortable good authentic Italian food. Service was impeccable very comfortable environment. The no cell phone policy made the meal much more enjoyable rather than hearing the person next to you talking to their kids of course one lady did answer her phone towards the end and she got scolded which made me happy because it was rude and she didn't need to answer it. The owner was named Mario and was amazing. He was very involved Hands-On and was at the tables making sure everyone had what they needed and enjoyed everything. They even came out to greet us at the door and offered to take the car and park it for us and sat us right away. They took our coats and hung them for us and we're very attentive to our every need. We were a party of five and they anticipated our needs and made sure we were satisfied and even stayed late because we ran late chatting and eating. This was a great experience I will definitely be back.,Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13119,45,33,Italian,4,09/21/2022,Nice atmosphere and Delicious Food! I met the owner and he is attentive to the patrons dining experience. Thank You Edwin!,Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13120,46,33,Italian,1,05/19/2022,Super racist!! It was the worst experience ever!! The host thought I didn’t speak Spanish in which he was speaking about us being a group of 7 ppl to another waitress. There parking fits only like 3 cars . This is the first time I see a restaurant that doesn’t allow cellphone use while in there .. sounds super fishy ..,Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13121,47,33,Italian,5,05/19/2022,"Best Alfredo! Much love thank you forthe dessert on the house. Also the new owner is really sweet, you don’t need a dress code to dine, which is so convenient. Thanks again!",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13122,48,33,Italian,5,05/19/2021,"I'm happy to announce has a long time customer they have reopened by a friend Mario, Edwin is the new owner and the food remains the same.  My wife was very happy to celebrate her birthday this year at the restaurant.    Welcome back guys!",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13123,49,33,Italian,3,05/20/2019,"Don't get me wrong, the food and service at this restaurant is great. The staff were very accommodating and friendly. They took our jackets upon arrival, very fancy shmancy. BUT... I docked off a point because the food isn't as good as you'd expect from a ""high class"" restaurant as they present themselves to be. So it was a bit disappointing. And another because I felt the price you paid for the taste of the food was a little high. This restaurant is not cheap. But for the price, I've eaten better Italian food for a bit cheaper. Overall, I was more on the disappointed side after the meal experience.",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13124,50,33,Italian,5,05/19/2020,Always a great time at Il Triangolo. Amazing food and great service.,Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13125,51,33,Italian,4,05/19/2022,Old school Italian restaurant with large portions.  Tiny parking lot. If you park there you will be interrupted during your meal to move your car. Small restaurant. Many people were dressed neatly. Service is attentive. They scrape bread crumbs off the table and change out your dishes and flatware when changing courses.,Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13126,52,33,Italian,5,05/20/2019,"Excellent food, service,  atmosphere.  Most authentic Italian food I've experienced.",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13127,53,33,Italian,5,05/20/2019,This is by far the most authentic Italian experience in dining I have had in many years.  The attention to detail is wonderful the courtesy of the staff is equal to the atmosphere in the dining area.  This is a family owned  And operated business which makes you feel like part of the family. My guest and I walked away from this restaurant feeling completely satisfied the food served here Was every last bit exactly what we had hoped for if you have the chance you must certainly make a reservation dress accordingly.,Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13128,54,33,Italian,5,05/20/2019,"This was my first time visiting. Mario, the owner, is absolutely great. He came by and said hello by name and let us know the specials for the night. The waiter accidentally spilled wine all over my date. They gave him a shirt to wear, gave us the wine on the house, and even gave him money to pay for the shirt to be dry cleaned. The food was absolutely delicious. Would definitely visit again. Highly recommend!!",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13129,55,33,Italian,5,11/20/2022,Me and my friends had a nice time is a quiet place good food.,Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13130,56,33,Italian,5,05/19/2022,"Old school Italian at its finest!! The service was fantastic and the food was even better. I do however recommend you give yourself around 3 hours to eat. It does take a little longer to get the food out, but it was amazing.",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13131,57,33,Italian,5,05/20/2017,"The food and wine was phenomenal. If you're looking for a cozy, old fashioned, romantic experience this is your place. Initially I wasn't going to be allowed in because of my attire but the owner let me slide this time. I get it though he is trying to maintain the vibe of the place. They also don't allow phones to be used during service which I also understand.    Come here for a nice romantic night out!",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13132,58,33,Italian,5,05/20/2018,"Amazing food with homemade pasta, reasonable prices for good food. They have a no cell phone at the table as well. It's cozy with nice wines and deserts also. I definitely recommend it, but the only bad part is finding park since there is no parking lot. The food portions are a good size and not super tiny like a lot of other places.",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13133,59,33,Italian,5,05/19/2020,Last night myself and two friends went to Il Triangolo for the first time. It definitely will NOT be my last. We loved everything we had from our appetizers down to the homemade napoleons for dessert. Mario is an awesome host and the wait staff was very accommodating. I will be returning after the holidays because I have to take my older brother there. I know he's going to enjoy it as much as I did. Thank you Mario for a great dining experience.

This place is your bring-back-memory neighborhood Italian eatery. Food is traditional and good, service is old-world and old NYC - just right. Understated but that's ok. They don't hover... but are there as needed.",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13135,61,33,Italian,2,05/19/2020,"The food was good but on another note it's like being inside a country ruled by a dictator. With all the strict dress codes and what not (which I totally understand) up until I had received an important text in which I had to answer.  Long story short Mario put his hand over my phone and told me no cellphones were allowed and not even in a nice way, he went about it rudely and nasty as if he forgot that I was a paying customer.  For the food quality and price i paid (which was expensive) i could of went to a nicer restaurant and not been harassed for answering a simple text message. I will not be going there again.",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13136,62,33,Italian,5,05/19/2021,One of the best! Authentic Southern  Italian food with a nice wine list and accommodating service.  One of those restaurants you'll definitely want to go back to.  Going on a weekend? Get a reservation.  Buon appetito!,Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13137,63,33,Italian,5,05/20/2019,"One of the best italian restaurants in New York. No cell phones on the tables, no shorts or tank tops. They mean it.",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13138,64,33,Italian,5,05/20/2019,"If you like quality Italian food, look no further than this restaurant. Fresh pasta, delicious sauces and tender meats makes this restaurant a spot you want to revisit. Mario the owner is a gracious person and his wife make you feel like you are dining at their house. Finish the meal with the homemade Lemoncello, it's a surprise treat.",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.

13140,66,33,Italian,5,05/20/2017,"Absolutely terrific! I invited my mom to dinner here and the owner greeted us with elegant eagerness. He took our jackets, showed us to our table, and served us food even though we did not make a reservation. The food is beyond this world: the bread was buttery, the salad was surreal (pear in salad ftw) and the pasta was rich and delicious. Would go again next time I'm in NYC",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13141,67,33,Italian,1,05/19/2020,"Food very good, nice setting, but the rules to follow were explained by the owner almost immediately after my wife and I sat down. This in itself is okay as i guess they want to create a certain atmosphere, but it could have been done in a more cordial way. I don't need to be reminded of my strict 7th grade science teacher Mr. Abramowitz when I'm celebrating my wedding anniversary.",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13142,68,33,Italian,1,05/20/2019,"We are two older gentlemen from California. We made a reservation a month prior to our visit. The host was incredibly rude to us. Even though we had a reservation he told us he wouldn’t seat us because we weren’t wearing collared shirts and that we had to leave. We both had on sweaters and slacks. We were not told that there was a dress code before this, but based on the attire worn by other patrons there at the time, I don’t believe that was the issue at all. Not sure if they are homophobic or what. Not only that, but there was no Uber available here, and after walking around for a long time in the cold looking for another place to eat, we were able to flag down a taxi and get back to our hotel. Scary place. I do wonder how the food is, but it doesn’t matter now because I would never go back there to find out.",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13143,69,33,Italian,5,05/19/2020,"OMG . . . What can I say ! From the friendly greeting when you first walk in to the attentive servers at your table,  you are absolutely made to feel like family.  The ambience around you and the aroma of garlic in the air takes you back to a time that once was.  The food was UNBELIEVABLE  and prepared so hot and delicious the way it should be.  This place is so recommended and must be experienced... but good luck trying to get a reservation lol ! Definitely worth the trip. God Bless Mario and his lovely wife Pierina... Ciao Ciao",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13144,70,33,Italian,3,05/20/2019,"I am going to give them three stars. Mario and his wife are wonderful enchanting people. The food is to die for. The wait staff are very attentive. The only problem I have is this obsession with not having your coat hanging off your chair. My lovely wife is often very hot, then very cold. There was one member of the wait staff, who gave us a very hard time over this. My wife explained her condition to him, but this man was relentless. To the point where he was actually nasty. Now I understand you have a policy, I gave him my coat. But when a woman tells you she will hold it on her lap, because she has a condition that causes her to be hot than cold. I think you can make an exception. Especially since the meals there are not cheap. Like I said, I like Mario and his wife, l love the food. But basically embarrassing my wife was unnecessary.",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13145,71,33,Italian,5,05/20/2019,"This restaurant is a gem, family owned business. The food was exquisite!! As appetizer he ordered the fritta calamari, as main course I ordered the Homemade fettuccine Al triangolo, as dessert we ordered the best ever Tiramisu and pannacota. Everything was excellent, service was great! This is a must go place for everyone! I agree with their policy of no cellphone on the table. We actually got to share a lot without the distraction of technology. I just loved the atmosphere!",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13146,72,33,Italian,2,05/20/2019,"I went here for dinner with my mom and sisters and was disappointed by the service.  I received a call to confirm my reservation along with an extensive list of rules including no flip flops for men, no kids ( which they repeated 2 times on the phone) and to dress with proper attire. We showed up to see many kids and the guy next to us in flip flops( none of which bothered us). What did bother us was when my sister got a call from her son who was sick, the waiter came over and rudely told us that this is an old fashion restaurant and we cannot be on the phone. When I tried to explain he ignored me and stated with authority that cell phones are not allowed that we need to leave the restaurant and take the call outside! The food was pretty good but because of the rudeness , we will never go back",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13147,73,33,Italian,5,05/20/2017,"Classy service with the warmth of a well managed, family-owned business. Many delicious homemade items include soppressata, pork sausage and various pastas. Cozy atmosphere that's perfect for holiday dinners or intimate date nights. You don't have to, but go ahead. Throw on a tie and make it special.",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13148,74,33,Italian,4,05/20/2017,I came here for brunch with my boyfriend. I actually heard about this place on Instagram. I saw someone post the patron bottles filled with some orange goodness and I was all in.  The place was smaller than expected but really nice. Our waitress was pretty friendly and helpful as well. I didn't know what I wanted to drink and she suggested my drink for me. I ordered the skirt steak with white rice and plantains and it was very good.  I'm going to give this place one more try later at night to see what the vibe is like. While we were there we were one of three tables being served so it was pretty quiet. Perfect for a nice brunch with my king.  The parking in the area is not as easy. We have to circle around a little bit to find a spot. After all that circling around we ended up finding a spot right in front of the restaurant and someone was just leaving.  This restaurant is not too far from home Queen friendly and has pretty good food. If I'm in the area again I'll definitely visit.    Oh yea! The prices were  about average for Queens. If you go Uptown to the Bronx or harlem....you'd pay half...but I guess you're paying for the ambiance.,Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13149,75,33,Italian,5,05/19/2020,"Very cozy intimate restaurant with great food, excellent service and personal attention.  Would highly recommend.  Please be aware there are a few rules.  The most important is no cell phones on the table.  It's a wonderful request.",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13150,76,33,Italian,1,05/19/2020,"I was visiting Queens for a wedding and wanted a pre-wedding dinner at a nice Italian restaurant.   With the great views i decided to reserve a spot on a Friday night.   Well with circumstances that happened the wedding was cancelled but i kept a reservation for 12 at the restaurant to take everyone out that came up to NY.   When we arrived my cousin was not allowed in because he had on shorts..  Khaki/cargo shorts with a polo shirt .  He looked nice.. an outfit that any Manhattan restaurant would have accepted.  He sent him down the street in the slum area to look for a pair of pants..  We were astonished..  since we were not from the area we had no idea of a dress code and Mario, the owner never mentioned it in any of my many phone calls to him.   We were shocked that Mario had become so rude not able to make an exception for my cousin even though he came all this way for a dinner with Family.   I saw men in ratty jeans and flip flops but i guess that was acceptable.   Mario should be taken to court for discrimination the way he acts.   Oh and all cell phones must be turned off and not see on the table (like school).   I never tasted the food even though i heard it was spectacular.   But food isn't everything when having a favorite restaurant.   Being treated like we matter is more important to me and Il Triangolo should be shut down because they don't care about people and their feelings.. Mario only cares about an image he is struggling to keep even though he is located in a horribly poor area.  I only gave it 1 star because it would not allow me to give it 'no stars'...",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13151,77,33,Italian,5,05/20/2019,"This place is what every restaurant aspires to be. Warm, inviting. Perfect service. Freshly prepared food beautifully presented. Host and owner Mario is the best. Note...there is valet parking and cell phone use is permitted. Bravo on all accounts.",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13152,78,33,Italian,5,05/19/2020,"Things to keep in mind: Fridays and Saturdays is dressy attire. Not like jacket and tie; more like button down/neat sweater clean jeans. It's also adults only. Don't panic when they take your coat. The space is small and coats on the backs of chairs are bulky.  Now the food. Amazing. Stamp of approval from my very Italian mother in law. Yes, they push a little heavy on their homemade wine but it's good!  Entrees are large. We saw neighbors eating ossobuco and it's huge. Carbonara was pleasantly light and tasty. Tiramisu was so friggin good.  The service is great. They did not rush us in any way, but it was a little difficult to get some attention for the bill. Busy Saturday night - get reservations!!",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13153,79,33,Italian,5,05/19/2021,Really loved my experience at IL Triangolo. Service was great. I had the Chicken Frangelico was which great and for dessert had a panettone bread pudding which may just be the best dessert Ive ever had in an Italian restaurant in NYC.

With a disgusted look towards my dad, we where there like 20 minutes and after various incidents like this we decided that it was enough and leave, can’t believe how somebody can be so entitled and disrespectful just because they work on a small restaurant in the middle of corona..",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.

13157,83,33,Italian,5,05/20/2016,"The food is great. Everything is homemade. The pasta, their wine, desserts,bread. The owner is the server. He can be a little uptight. He has his rules.

13161,87,33,Italian,3,05/19/2020,This was my 2nd time here and I was disappointed. My hot antipasto was over cooked. The homemade wine was pretty good but the filet mignon special was not what I expected. I didn't like the flavor of the sauce and aged cheese wasn't to my liking.,Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13162,88,33,Italian,5,05/20/2019,Food was fresh and delicious. The lobster ravioli special was out of this world. It was our first time here and they easily accommodated us on a busy Father's Day.,Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.

Superb dining experience!,Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13164,90,33,Italian,5,05/20/2019,"Perhaps the cleanest, most organized restaurant I've ever seen in New York. Everything is spotless and homey. Food was great. Service was great. Normally a small restaurant that's been around in Queens since the 80s feels dated, worn, and a bit like a throwback. Not this place. They've kept up with the times where it matters and kept it old school where it counts..that means no tshirts, no phones out,  winter jackets get hung in the closet. It bothers some but truth is we could all use a few rules to help us enjoy each others company...molto bene. Vai e divertiti!",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.
13165,91,33,Italian,1,05/19/2020,"There are so many fine restaurants in New York City, but unfortunately, Triangolo is Not one of them...    The food is overpriced and overestimated. Accompanied by Italian ideology centered, arrogant employees, acting as if you owe them the world and don't belong to the elite class had made it a horrifying dining experience.    Give yourself a break and find another place to eat. Or, be prepared to be segregated and discriminated while paying more than you should.",Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.

13177,105,33,Italian,5,05/20/2017,"LOL ! At first glance you say to yourself. ""Wow"" small but comforting. Then the owner Mario welcomes you like family and immediately sits you down and gives you these amazing chicken meatballs with bread you would have thought was made by angels. Now you feel at home and can't wait to order. My only regret was not going with 8 people so you could all order something different and try everything. I'm a big  Sicilian guy weighing in at around 350 and I left stuffed. If he had a couch , I would have been on it. The black linguini is by far the blackest linguini you will ever have anywhere with the most Flavor. ""I didn't share"" I shreadded through it like I hadn't eaten in a month.

13282,218,33,Italian,5,05/12/2023,Tucked away in the heart of Corona (Once a vibrant Italian American community; now a melting pot of Asian and Latino immigrants) stands Il Triangolo. The area is obviously sketchy if you're an out of towner but having grown up here in Corona and a product of immigrants I did not at all feel threatened by the hard working foreigners try to carve out a piece of the American dream. Anyway the food is great. I ordered the special of the day which was at least 10oz of pork chop breaded and deep fried with a delicious mix of grape vine tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella.  The Calamari and Clams appetizers were also delicious. The Sangria was refreshing and was accompanied by a medley of fresh sliced fruits and a hint of lemon zest. Expect to spend about $70+ per person. Take the 7 train to 90th street then walk about one mile south thru the richly cultural streets.,Triangolo Restaurant,96-01 Corona Ave.

13567,21,35,Italian,1,02/18/2023,"This review is mainly about the parking lot and the experience I had. There is an unauthorized tow truck that stalks this parking lot and has people walk around the parking lot stalking the patrons and towing the cars. I understand towing the cars of people who illegally park, but there’s an entrance to Olive Garden around the corner, so I heard one of the spy say to take a car of a family with a stroller so I informed the mom - as I informed the mom the spy started yelling at me that he’s still taking their car…. Mind you the family was on the side walk by Olive Garden and insisting they were going to eat at Olive Garden. I called Olive Garden to inform them their patrons were being harassed and this could potentially be an issue for them and they said there was nothing they can do…. So please everyone be careful and make sure you have your receipt and do not stop in any other stores",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave

13569,24,35,Italian,1,04/19/2023,"Absolutely disgusting. After skipping out on Olive Garden for a few months, I finally decided to go and eat here. The host was a little rude, but that was overlooked quickly because my guest and I sat down right when I got there. My friend and I ordered pasta, I got the spaghetti with marinara sauce and added shrimp. I forgot what my friend got, but it did look like cheese ravioli with chicken just doused in white sauce. I personally do not like white sauce, and I skipped out on it. Now, let's fast forward to the next day. I woke up in pain, found out my friend woke up in pain as well. Both of us caught food poisoning and can't eat a single thing all day. I've personally been with an upset stomach, sluggishness, and frequently visiting the restroom today. I'm not feeling alright and even canceled my plans for today and was not able to eat anything. As for him, he got it even worse. He mentioned he's been throwing up, not been able to eat a single thing all day, not been able to move, sensitive stomach to the point where he did not even leave his house for work.

We ordered the eggplant parmigiana with spaghetti and a soup pasta fazuli.  I had the soup to myself. Ok my mom makes it better but this was VERY GOOD!  It was a large bowl. The Eggplant Parmigiana and spaghetti my mom had most of it and for my mom to like something from a restaurant is rare. She REALLYenjoyed it, I had a few bites and next time I’m getting my own.

13576,31,35,Italian,4,02/18/2023,"I am shocked to give 4 stars only because of MEDINA who waited our table. Otherwise this place is a joke. Soon as you enter the girls at the front dont greet or anything. As if you are actually interrupting them for asking for a table and you have to greet them and thank them for actually finding you a table. We usually have really bad service here and we still go since its the only OG we have in our nearby. Yesterday we went there with knowing to be disappointed however, god sent us Medina and she was one charming staff. Our drinks, to food came on time and we didnt even have to ask her for anything she just came and asked us. She was not those annoyingly attentive where you are putting your food in your mouth and the staff came to ask you, but she just came on right time and made things super nice. SO next time i go there, i will be praying for table that she waits. Shout out to MEDINA.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave

Both times, the servers I had were attentive and it didn't take long to be seated (today it took no time at all at 1 PM on a Sunday).    Food was good. Breadsticks are as advertised. The Zuppa Toscana was particularly tasty. I also had the chicken fritta w/meatsauce over rigatoni - the chicken was nice and crunchy. The seconds on the endless pasta bowl came in a smaller plate but I won't ding them a star over that.    They also make good cappuccinos.

I came here with my husband and I usually order the same thing ""create your own pasta"" I ordered a salad and after few bites I saw a few bugs in my salad. I was grossed out and had to spit it out. My husband immediately called the waiter and told him what happened. He told us the manager generously gave us a 25% discount. But other than that, I will never come back here again!",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave
13597,52,35,Italian,1,11/20/2022,Food was horrible meat sauce taste sour and had a grease taste.  Chicken was dry and with no seasoning.

13598,53,35,Italian,4,04/19/2023,"I usually come here at least once a week. Most pastas here are delicious and most servers are friendly if not just neutral. The atmosphere is nice and calm. The food takes a reasonable time, but sometimes it takes a long time for the servers to take your order. Depending on the type of pasta, the portion varies (pastas like five cheese ziti was a really big portion, but others such as spaghetti and fettuccine were less). Sometimes the fettuccine Alfredo is tasteless and don’t order mushrooms for pasta because they are not throughly cleaned. I have to say that the breadsticks can be very disappointing sometimes (just come at the right time when the breadsticks are fresh) and most people come here for it. A lot of the times, the breadsticks are dry and hard :( Overall, it’s a nice place.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave
13599,54,35,Italian,1,01/19/2023,"Food was OK. The server was fine.  I had an issue with the Handicap Parking being full with cars without a permit. And I'm disabled.  When I addressed it inside, they told me they had nothing to do with the parking lot. I called a number that was posted outside, got an answering service. That's unacceptable that Olive Garden deals with disabled people like this.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave

He asked if we wanted to move tables, absolutely nothing against the waiter but after seeing that i did not want to eat there anymore. If there was one walking on the wall, it obviously wasnt the only one and I can’t imagine the kitchen. Def will not be coming back to this location. We cancelled our dinner order and walked out.

From the beginning they put us 2 new tables next to each other, at the same time with 1 waiter, that couldn't handle a thing. On top of that the food was so bad.

It was late Sunday evening and none of wanted to cook so we decided to go to cheesecake factory but the wait over there was and 1 hour long..so we decided to go to Olive Garden as it was right across the street and near by to us. I guess I would have given this place a 4.5 stars if I was living in Midwest but since me being from NY I have been spoiled by better Italian food! I still don't get why they would give bread and salad refill if you order soup ( hope the Restaurent is making $$) and also on other side makes you question how fresh are those salad! But surprisingly they were still good! Love their bread sticks though. I ordered a shrimp and chicken pasta and it was lacking flavor but I did finished my pasta as I was hungry.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave
13618,73,35,Italian,3,05/20/2018,"I actually really like the food at Olive Garden but this particular outpost by the mall has the worst service.  The last time we went to eat here we waited ten minutes to even talk to the hostess. There were two young ladies at the desk and both were too busy chatting with each other to bother saying hello. We ended up interrupting them to say we would like to be seated. Then it was another ten minutes to get a waiter to take our order. Thankfully you can pay your check via the terminal at your table.

Wouldn't go back here.    Update    Ok I went back and my food was inedible. I only ate bread sticks and salad. My food was utterly disgusting. It looked like dog food. My kids didn't enjoy their food either. What a waste of money. The lasagna was disgusting and so was the fettuccine Alfredo and the Chicken Parmesan was burnt.

13646,101,35,Italian,1,08/22/2022,"Food made me nauseous. Not sure what I was thinking coming here. Even the bread sticks were too salty couldn't even taste the bread. Disappointed isn't even the word. It probably isn't the chefs fault, you can't make good food out of frozen meats and overcooked pasta.  The salad was good though. Seemed like mass produced packaged salad but it tasted decent.  Take your time, make the food to order not mass produced. Heating up the plate doesn't mean the lasagna isn't cold in the middle. I won't be coming back but please do better for patrons that do.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave

Before we left the Elmhurst location on 9/7/21, my son and I, we both witnessed when the waitress helped us make the payment of our check through the electronic device that they have placed on each table. The total for our dinner was 60 dollars and some cents. Unfortunately I did not ask for a paper receipt. Dinner was okay, waitress was nice. My surprise was at the time I came home and checked on my credit card account. Olive Garden charged not 60 but 103 dollars!!! The tip for the waitress was left in cash, so it’s no explanation for any charges beyond 60 dollars. Dinner was: spaghetti marinara with meatballs for my son, and ravioli with meat sauce for me. No desserts. My son got a lemonade, I got regular water.  The most expensive and tricky dinner ever!!",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave

Our waiter Edwin did his best given that it seemed like the placed was short staffed, However it didnt seem like the place was short staffed since I saw a bunch of staff sitting in one table loitering, eating outside good, and just hanging out with casual dressed individuals. Occassionally they would deliver drinks but would then go back at that table to hang out and chitchat. Our waiter did everything on our side of the restaurant, he was the waiter for almost all the tables in our area and he was the bartender. As if he lost a bet and had to handle everything. An Individual wearing a maroon shirt seemed like he was the manager was also just sitting in this table even though he can noticed that his staff was overwhelmed. Definitely disappointed with our dining experience last friday and at the same time felt bad for our waiter as he was doing all the work. I cant fault the waiter as he is doing the best of his capabilities given that there is no support staff. It seemed like there was no management at all.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave

The server I got today never refilled my water the entire time, I had to use the tablet to call the server to ask to close the tab, and when my 3 year old said hi to her she just proceeded to ask if we were ready to order yet. Stephanie refills without having to ask, and she loves kids. The food is also inconsistent. Sometimes the salad is dry to order extra dressing on the side. The pasta is great but the sauce can be sparingly provided at times. Today was a good day for the food but not so great day for the service. As a regular, I always tip 20% or higher but regardless of that Stephanie was the best so far out of the 12 visits we have had so far at this location.

Host j argued with us about sitting down early waiting for our other two guests because my mother has Alzheimer’s and was getting too confused as a door with all the people coming in and out. They didn’t care!  they said the only way we can sit as if we order drinks first( drinks never came till after our food). The server came and brought our food without our drinks and never came with refills once we did get our drinks. The server didn’t come ask is how anything is or offer a salt pepper or anything! I had to hunt down the waitress to get salt and pepper for everyone at my table! Everything about this place is horrible and it all starts with the workers and their poor performance and horrible attitude!,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave
13734,189,35,Italian,1,05/19/2022,"Very unprofessional staff. I called to ask if there was a wait and was told there wasn’t. Once I arrived to the facility I was told I couldn’t be seated-after driving about an hour to the restaurant. If you ask me all members should be trained on what to say to guest when calling about a wait time. And I know the future can’t be predicted, but that could’ve been said especially if you can’t make reservations. The lady at the front desk was very nasty and said no and that there was no way I was eating at the facility. I’m glad that I was turned away because that isn’t how you treat any guest trying to eat at a restaurant.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave
13735,190,35,Italian,5,05/20/2019,Normally it's very packed. The average wait time is around 15 min for 2 people tables. You get unlimited refill of bread sticks and choice of salad or soup for each entree. The irony here is we found the breadstick and soup to be better than the entree itself. Service is great and there is a machine for you to pay with your card on each desk once you are done. Great when it's busy but don't forget to tip your waiter though.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave

13741,196,35,Italian,1,05/19/2022,The waiter was more of like scam person. His communication was bad. He told us to order entrees and soup and salad will come along the entrees. We order 4 entrees and 2 soups for extra order. He was supposed to bring us 4 entrees with 4 salad (like he explained us while taking order) but he brought us 4 entrees 3 salads and 2 soups. We didn't realise at that time but at the time of check out the bill was over charged mentioning 7 salads and 6 soups. We try to ask with the server but he was rude and disrespectful. New York visitors should get this type of bad experience.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave
13742,197,35,Italian,1,05/19/2022,"My waiter very unprofessional, volita I think? She treated my table very poorly, I honestly believe it was because we were a younger crowd and she profiled us. When she came to the table, she did not say her name, she said what you all want after we ordered our drinks and food, she took about 15 min to come back with our drinks crazy right? No! She took nearly 50 minutes to come out with our order and on top of that left the bill on top of our table basically dismissing us, i went at 5 pm….",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave

It taste like it was grill in oil. It had a strong grill taste. Just awful. It should have had garlic butter, herbs, salt and pepper. It was juicy and plain tasting.

Extremely unpleasant experience due to lack of professionalism of their staff. The waiter, the bartender along with the manager showed absolutely worst service provide for its first time customers and I have to say after such unprofessionalism and rude behavior I would not step my foot in there even if I was offered to have 10 free meals. Do not take your chances of going to such place unless you in a mood to test your patience and be spoken and treated disrespectfully by their employees. NEGATIVE IS NOT THE WORD.

I saw the staff trying to assist the people but no one was cleaning. The floors were so dirty with paper everywhere it did not have a good smell to it. It was stuffy like the AC was on low. After being in the mood for some pasta had to walk out and go right across to Longhorn. I’m very disappointed with Olive Garden. Do not go across the street to Cheese Cake Factory. I went there about 2 months ago and was served with plastic in my food. Another bad experience horrible!,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave

The salad was brought to us first, but no drinks were brought to the table until we were finished eating the salad. Seemed like we were bothering her when we asked for a second serving of soup. Even when we had no more breadsticks at the table, she never asked if we wanted more. I don't recall ever writing a bad review about a restaurant before, and I eat out quite often, so the service definitely was way below what I am accustomed to..But the soup and salad were good as always, so  not a total waste...",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave

13754,209,35,Italian,3,05/19/2020,"Had a lovely waitress who was more than happy to give us more breadsticks when we asked for it. My friend and I are both ordered baked pasta dishes. I had the chicken tortellini, which was delicious. My friend got the seafood rigatoni, which didn't really taste that great. It was as if the pasta was too wet for the sauce to stick to it. I also ordered off the $5 drinks menu, which included a delicious watermelon margarita. Got some complimentary chocolates with our check, which is a nice touch. Personally, I had a good experience at this Olive Garden. My friend though, not so much, but to each their own! I would definitely go again.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave
13755,210,35,Italian,1,05/20/2019,"My family and I went to Olive Garden this past weekend. It was 4 adults and 3 hungry children. When we arrived the hosts said it was a 30-40 minute wait. About 8 minutes later they called our name and seated us. We could not believe it, we were seated and handed menu's. We waited at our table 40-50 minutes before the manager finally came over and took our order. During those 40-50 minutes of waiting, we got up and  asked who was going to assist our table and never got a direct answer. My children were so hungry, good thing I had granola bars while they waited, we asked for bread at least until someone could assist us. No one was ever assigned to our table. I'm not sure if they were too busy, under staffed but we actually heard a waitress say she's not taking our table which was completely fine if someone else would have assisted us within a timely manner. Fast forward, we finally got our food and no one came to check on your table. No one asked if we wanted cheese, another refill, just dropped the food. When we were all done we had to look for someone to bring us our check.  Not sure if we will be back anytime soon, it was upsetting making my children wait so long before taking our order.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave

The take home meal for $5 was totally screwd up and confusing.

I asked if the could add mozzarella cheese to my dish and they did, wasn't a fan of the meatballs though. Service was good, nice servers, though my friends dish took a while to come out.

The new girl there didn't girl there didn't know what she was doing. And the bartender stepped away for quite awhile. Then we finally ordered and the new girl gave away one of our dishes to another table because she didn't know any better.

13775,230,35,Italian,1,05/19/2020,"First, the management needs to train their employees on proper customer care. Without us, there is no you. The hostess refused to sit me and my friend in a comfortable area because we had a stroller. She said it's a fire hazard and she couldn't allow us to sit in a booth. I asked if we could sit in a corner of the restaurant so the stroller is not in the way and we were comfortable. She told us she could not allow us to choose our seats and we could leave if we were not comfortable. There was only ONE booth taken, the rest of the space was completely empty. I would have understood if the place was packed, but one booth and we were not allowed to sit in a booth for comfort is a joke! We walked out and went across the street to the Cheesecake Factory where we were seated very comfortably with the ""fire hazard"" stroller right next to us and treated with respect. I would not recommend other stroller pushing moms to come here!!",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave

After almost finishing our food (finally!!!) She then comes to our table with the dishes we returned and was giving my 9 year old an attitude telling him ""this is the dish you order, why are you returning it? Here take it"" I stepped in and refused it because my son already finished another dish they brought saying it was his order. I don't blame my server because he was very nice but the General Manager. She needs to control her anger, speak to people the same way she would like to be spoken back and listen attentively to what is been asked. I feel sorry for those dishes being returned but it's not what we asked. If am paying for my food I deserve to get what I ask.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave

Someone must've forgotten to wipe down the table. Spilled wine and grease were still visible. And the napkins were already set on it. This should've been the first warning sign.    After we got seated we had to wait a while for the server. We figured, it's a Sunday night, they're busy, understandable. We've all worked in the bottom of the barrel jobs. So we waited. Then we noticed no one came to our table and newly seated guests were being served. I had to flag down nearby waiters to ask for a waiter. It appeared that no one was stationed to this table. This table is a blind spot in the restaurant. When they found out, a waiter was assigned immediately. And took all our orders at once.    When we were done with the appetizer, they stacked the dirty dishes all at the corner. No one bothered to pick them up for the rest of the meal.    The food was mediocre. Nothing too bad to say about it.    After the meal,  we returned to the original problem. We wanted to pay our bill, but it seems our table was forgotten again. Seriously, why does this table even exist?! Assign or get rid of this table, you are subjecting paying customers to a void zone. We flagged down the waitress in the nearby station, asked for the bill. Not sure if she cared or listened because we had to flag down 2 more servers for the bill. We gave a tip because we felt sympathetic.    Again, get rid of that table. Put a potted plant in its place. Put up another wine rack.

We ordered some mozzarella sticks and other things as entree. Those mozzarella sticks was empty.... Also there was this kid crying during all the dinner. When we left I said ""have a good night"" to the 4 employees at the front desk. They looked at us and didn't say anything.  It was an aweful experience.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave
13798,254,35,Italian,5,05/19/2021,"Overall this is a really great location.    Food was hot and ready.    The make your own pasta was good too.    Love the Free Breadsticks, just wish the sauce was free too, LOL",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave
13799,255,35,Italian,1,05/20/2018,"Overall it was not the best experience. For starters they ran out of a particular soup and it was only 7pm. We were never asked if we wanted more soup, salad or breadsticks during our time there. Waitress was a bit flustered, not sure if she was new. I will have to think twice about going back.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave
13800,256,35,Italian,5,05/19/2021,I had the chicken marsala. Our waiter Alphonse was soo accommodating. He kindly got extra mushrooms for me and was super attentive. We had a great time and the endless breadsticks and salad never fail lol,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave
13801,257,35,Italian,1,05/20/2018,"The bathroom was dirty.  They made us changed tables I don't know why, when I looked 10 minutes later someone else was sitting there. Why?  Took another 10 minute to meet the waiter.  I ordered the shrimp scampi, the spaghetti was horrible, had some white sauce that tasted stale and mushy. I just at the shrimp.  At the end the waiter, when paying, he put the card in the small machine, then when the tip came up he was like ""this is the suggested amount that's fine right"", it was about 24% undeserved. Though my date paid as he was being courteous, that is absolutely rude and unprofessionally to do that. It was overall a very disappointing experience.  Management should really speak to their staff about that.  Will not be going back to that location.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave
13802,258,35,Italian,3,05/20/2017,"The food was okay.  My husband's first bowl of soup was kind of oily.  When questioned, our server told us that his first bowl of soup was from the morning and she had it changed to a fresh batch after that.  It would've been better to make us wait slightly longer for the fresh batch than serve the morning batch so that we didn't have to wait.  (That was the reason she gave.)  Eh.  They recently got the ability to pay via Samsung Pay as well.  For now, you get $5 off your meal when you pay with your phone.  (At least it did when we went there.) It was a so-so experience all around.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave
13803,259,35,Italian,5,05/19/2020,I always have a wonderful time at Olive Garden. The waiters here are friendly and courtesy. I always bring my girlfriends here for lunch and dinner.

13804,261,35,Italian,3,05/20/2018,"We really enjoy Olive Garden.  This location can be hit or miss.  It gets very crowded on weekends, resulting in waits close to an hour.  The last time we visited the hostess completely forgot about us - seating many who arrived after we did.  When confronted, she didn't even acknowledge us and we were directed to someone else.  That being said, it was just a bump in an otherwise pleasant night out.  The wait staff seems to be very well-trained and are friendly and accommodating.  We enjoyed our meals, as we always do.  Portion sizes vary from visit to visit.  Sometimes soup bowls are filled to the top, other times it seems there's barely a ladle-ful.  But hey, you can always have another.  An area in need of improvement would be cleanliness - the place is looking a little tired and worn and it's one of the newest locations we visit.  Our biggest beef is parking.  They have a dedicated lot for the restaurants (free), but there's never a spot because they are all taken by people shopping at the mall who don't want to pay for parking in the mall's garage.  There is no street parking nearby, which makes visiting this particular location very frustrating.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave
13805,262,35,Italian,4,05/20/2018,"Visited this place around 3 in the afternoon with no waiting and plenty of available tables, I've seen it packed during peak dinner hours though. Nicely located across the street from queens center mall. Free parking. The service was great even though they speak to you a bit on the ghetto-ish side. Food comes out quick, fresh and hot. Its olive garden food, you either lo...like it or hate it. A little more professional attitude from the servers and this place would've received 5/5 because this spot was on point with everything else.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave

13807,264,35,Italian,2,05/20/2018,Bathroom was nasty. Looked like the only thing that was done to the bathroom was toilet paper was replaced. Waitress was nice but forgot lemon for water 3 times. Associates by pickup area were loud. Front desk girl had an argument with a customer and got pulled to the side. While I ate she complained about the customers. Food needed salt.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave

13809,266,35,Italian,1,05/20/2016,"The seating service is rediculous, they are the worst ever! We witnessed 8 empty tables and tons of people waiting to be seated, asked the manager and he gave us a lame excuse that they were short of silverware. However, 1 minute after asking here comes a huge tray of silverware. We thought our server was going to be better, NOPE terrible. I'm an Olive Garden lover but this location's staff is horrible. I would of been better starving at home.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave
13810,267,35,Italian,2,05/19/2020,"I feel like most people go to Olive Garden for the breadsticks and salad at this point.    The food in this place is not good, and it’s rarely warm. It got a B rating from the health department. On an even remotely busy night, service is incredibly slow because they need more wait staff. Most times the waiters and waitresses are very kind, so I wouldn’t want to say anything negative towards them... BUT they do seem to get very overwhelmed and will bring you the wrong dish to your table or take thirty minutes to bring you your drinks.    I remember when I was younger, the closest Olive Garden to me was in Long Island. This was a classy Olive Garden. You didn’t enter this Olive Garden looking a mess. This was before they simplified their logo into something less pretty & professional. At least the old Olive Garden *tried* to pretend to be an authentic Italian restaurant. Now, you’re lucky if they hand you something even resembling pasta.    Extra star because even on a day when the breadsticks aren’t that good... I love those sticks.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave

13813,270,35,Italian,2,05/20/2018,"I have been there numerous times and the quality of food is very inconsistent. But the last few trips weren't pleasant. Especially the very last time I went there for lunch on a Wednesday with a company of four, the waitresses recommendation was horrible, the robotic smile unfortunately didn't help with our appetite. And at the end the waitress asked for a 20% tip and stated that it is the ""suggested "" tip. Although she asked if I was ok with it, I still feel manipulated. The amount of tip to be given is determined by the customer base on how satisfactory with their services, since when it became dictated by the waiter/waitresses themselves?  Anyway, I have completed lost the desire to go there again...",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave

Alot of pasta specials but not consisting with meat or seafood.  Also big plus is all the free bread & salads you can eat. Service was not too good.

13820,277,35,Italian,1,05/20/2019,"My experience at this place was so,so. The hostess was very friendly and welcoming. I was placed to sit in a both seat.I waited for 10 minutes for the server to take my order.While sitting I thought to myself that this person is taking a long time.So the server finally came to the table. She immediately said  What can I get for you. No hello ,my name is so and so , nothing. The server then said to what can I get for you ,she didn’t even do any promotion sales nothing.  The main reason I wanted to have dinner at Olive Garden was because of the promotion deal with the Lasagna.Otherwise , I wouldn’t of went to the Olive Garden because I don’t really desire it.I told the waitress to order me a ginger ale because I don’t drink liquor.She did ask if I wanted any water no nothing a double negative!As I asked for the ginger ale she asked me if I’m waiting for someone because I did want to placed my order in her timely order.I then replied no and told her that by the time she returns with the drink I’d be ready to order.Right then and there I understood that she was already  annoyed. For what reason , I don’t know. The reason I could tell the waitress was annoyed was because she rolled her eyes while going to place the order. I didn’t make any fuss to the manager . I left the ginger ale on the table and told the hostess to cancel my order because the waitress was rude to me. She then asked me if I wanted her to call the managers, I told her no . There is no need to call the manager. I mean let’s be real they’d probably say they’ll do something about the situation but pacify her when I leave. I didn’t even bother ,I just walked out and ate somewhere else. That waitress rating from me is negative zero.She was nasty and prejudice. She don’t know where life can take her.I don’t recommend this  Rego Park Olive Garden to anyone. Plus I was by myself and she treated me this way. So unfair!",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave
13821,278,35,Italian,1,05/20/2019,"The service was horrible. The server gave us the wrong bill which was $100 more than what our actual bill was. So we just figured maybe our server was new or in training, people make mistakes no big deal. Then when we get our bill we where charged for a dessert that we ordered but never received and where charged for soup and salad in addition to our entrees. Once we straighten that out my son goes to pay the bill and they charged him an additional $75 dollars which by the way takes 3-5 business days to return to his account. HORRIBLE SERVICE! I think they where trying the pad the bill. I love Olive Garden, but it seems to me that the only good ones are in Albuquerque New Mexico. Albuquerques Olive Garden Rocks! I've been to Olive Garden in Amarillo and New York and they SUCK! Oh, my mother got from the soup. And the only reason I'm giving them a 1 star is because I can't figure out how to give them a 1/2 star because they don't deserve the 1.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave

But it was late and this was one of the only places open after 9 in the area. When we finally got sat our waitress was friendly but not as attentive to my table as she was with the rest. Only seen her 3 times, We asked for things and either took forever or never got it. Our food was not hot and had little to no sauce on my alfredo which was bland at best.

The breadsticks which I love disappointed me as well they were crispy not soft the beef and parpadelle pasta had no beef it was pork. My son order his steak med it came med rare plus the pasta side was so small unbelievable.my husband had the tour of Italy and it wasn’t good either the lasagna did not taste well. I use to go to Olive Garden every once in a while and the food was always great never a disappointment but this time the only thing we enjoyed was the tiramisu. Plus the waiter stayed with us while we were paying on the machine to see if she got a tip. Not good at all will not be returning there.

When I came in I sat 30 minutes next to dirty dishes and a glass of white wine before being greeted. There were 2 bartenders.  One doing tickets the other Carlos, doing nothing.  He finally greeted me and I ordered a water and a glass of  Malbec . He was busy doing ... Nothing ... Then looked around for the bottle of wine and while slowly opening it started talking to the bar guests that I know frequent because they were asking for a girl who was working in the kitchen.  Finally received the wine. I had to ask again for the water and never recieved a menu . I was waiting for my boyfriend to arrive so I put on a show . During this time the other bartender went yo the bathroom.  The tickets started piling up.  Carlos ignored them . He wasn't going anything there were the same dishes around me and more on the side of the bar that he never once touched.  As the tickets piled up the servers started shouting to him asking him please for drinks and his response 3 TIMES. Was ""sounds like a personal issue to me "" . When the manager turned the corner he finally hopped to his job and threw the other guy under the bus as if he were gone forever but he was clearly using the bathroom . 10 minutes most . Took forever for them to acknowledge my boyfriend when he came . Didn't check on food.  Didn't clear it . Took forever to offer the check and never came back to clean it up . Watch the cameras. I told the manager at the end and he said ""I'm sorry for the experience"" ,I told him to cut his losses and remove that employee immediately .",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave

The food took an incredible amount of time to get to the table. The marinara sauce was extremely watery. The complimentary salad they're known to given out was less than half filled, barely enough to split evenly amongst three people. And the sauteed shrimp paired with the new stuffed ziti frita was so pale and had an appearance of being undercooked. A very disappointing experience would never go to this particular Olive Garden again.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave

The waitress also walk pass by my family and she ignores the fact that she didn't take our order. So we left Olive Garden and never came again!,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave

13858,317,35,Italian,3,05/20/2018,"We were seated near the door and were passed by just about everyone who walked into the door. On my way to the restroom, i passed maaaannnnyyy open booths with more privacy so i didnt understand why we were seated at the door. Our server had a lot of tables in his area and did take awhile to get to us but i dont blame him because he wasnt the one who sat us in his area of service. When our meal was halfway over, my party was able to enjoy a little show of affection between two crewmembers (how professional!). The food wasn't the greatest, but our server was friendly and accommodating so it made the experience a little better.    ***REMOVE THE RULE REQUIRING ALL PARTY MEMBERS MUST BE PRESENT TO BE SEATED*** Your establishment is huge, that rule is an epic inconvenience. Especially considering the fact that the menu is basic Italian and others can be ordered for if everyone has already communicated what they planned on ordering.

When we sat down with my Fiance and step daughter we sat there for 25 mins and saw NO ONE. No drinks, no orders made and no waiter/waitress at all. Right before we got up and left a table of seven had just sat down and immediately got there drinks and orders in and the waitress wanted to come off with an attitude and say to us that she would be right with us after walking past us on five different occasions. This place is a joke. Dont wanna work there? Than do yourself the favor and dont work there and as for the business, hire a staff that knows what they're doing.  ***Side Note*** Longhorn Steakhouse next door sat us down and got our orders the second we walked through the doors.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave

13865,324,35,Italian,3,05/20/2019,"I am changing my rating simply because I think this Olive Garden needs a little help. I sat at the bar on a Monday night with a friend for dinner, and although Andre seemed pleasing and lovely by using a pet name after every offering (""here you go my loves, here's you drink my love"") there were quite a few things lacking on this visit to Olive Garden.  We were never offered more salad or breadsticks, which is an Olive Garden trademark, last time I checked. We did have to ask for a 2nd round. Both times the salad came out, it was strangely small and overwhelmingly filled with more onions than lettuce (Do the servers/bartenders still have to dress their own salads? Because this needs serious attention.) We also ordered our salad right away, but we were told that he wasn't going to order it until we placed the order for our entrees, even though I ordered stuffed mushrooms as well. The mushrooms came before the salad and bread. At that time, we were asked to confirm the order for our entree that we had already placed(because he hadn't put it in.....wait a minute?What? But we got our salad?) Our bartender had taken our order, dissatisfied that we only ordered one appetizer, we ordered drinks from the happy hour, and that we didn't want to order any of the ""new promotions"" Olive Garden was doing with the new menu for the first day.  He quite literally said ""awe borrrriinnngg"". We had not established such a relationship so this was a little awkward that we felt judged for our choices.  This behavior continued throughout the meal, trying to upsell us on absolutely everything, even $1 on the second beer my friend had that was on happy hour. ""The bigger size is only a $1 more, for future reference."" Uhhh... could have found a kinder way to put that, but ny friend agreed to it anyway. There had been 6 people at the bar including us, two had left and their food dishes sat there at the bar for a good 25 minutes after they left. The 2 next to us had fishined eating and never had their dishes cleared, and we sat for at least 15 minutes looking at the remnants of ours, waiting to ask for a box. As much as he tried to upsell us on appetizers and entrees, we were never offered another drink (had to ask) and we were never offered coffee or dessert (which we may have done) but we ended up finally asking for the check because we were literally sitting there waiting to catch eyes with our bartender to get the time of day.  In defense of the bartender,  I am aware there is only one if him to make cocktails for the entire restaurant (servers had an impromptu wine by the glass station set up in the middle of the dining area on a table behind us, which I also thought to be strange..because it's usually a table where people dine.) However, the bartender made a comment to someone about how slow it was, but seemed very overwhelmed. I think they are in need of some support staff at the bar.  Otherwise, I don't know if I'd offer for guests to dine there.  As we pay the bill, the bartender takes off his apron and also his black button down uniform shirt, wearing only a black tshirt, which I'm sure doesn't fit uniform code..ok. Then came around the bar and finally bussed the dishes off the bar from the guests that had left a half hour ago. My friend then witnessed a manager pour an alcoholic drink into a kids cup, and walk into the back. We thought ""ooooh, they must be  closing up"" because that's the kind of behavior we were observing. However as we walked out the door, we saw guests just starting with their salads. When I checked the time, it was an hour before closing. I've been here a couple times, and its always pretty hectic,  but this was a Monday night and my service was sub par, and I think that's more than fair to say. Over all, this location needs help, possibly new management if they are not already aware of these types of problems.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave
13866,325,35,Italian,5,05/20/2017,"Today was the first major snow day of the year (which makes sense since it's only the 7th) this meant that  people were indoors instead of heading out, which means there was no wait time to be seated.

The food here is pretty good but the dish that really stands out is the chicken and shrimp carbonara. It is very tasty and our server highly recommended it.  As far as our server Jamal was concerned, he was very nice, friendly and has thorough knowledge of the whole menu top to bottom, left to right.  However, the carpet needed some cleaning and vacuuming and some tables needed cleaning and/or setting up. We were seated at a table that was not set up yet. The salad came out first before the silverware lol This is why I deducted one star. Personally, I am very particular when it comes to cleanliness and very attentive to detail.  I will definitely come back here from time to time and can't wait to try their other dishes.

Almost embarrassing with the service we received. The place was not even packed so do not understand the lack of service we rcvd, I even had to go to the front to get service coz my waiter was MIA for a long time and we were ready to order. After placing order then our appz came but no plates. Had to flag down a bus boy for some after we were nearly done with our appz. Not to mention our waiter tilted out calamari plate and 1/3 was on the tray and he didn't even bother to fix the plate of whats left! Entrees came and our drink orders still didn't come..n when it did we were missing some drink orders. The whole time no apology from waiter, all we got was his nonchalant attitude as if he doesnt even wanna be there. Really did not care to tip but ended up tipping the 15%.

I could have picked up my order by then. Someone finally answered and I told him my order. The guy sounded like he had no idea what he was doing, I had to repeat myself three times and what got my upset more is that the online menu is different then the in restaurant menu.

We ordered 2 plates of pasta and one pepsi. My husband did not like the sausage on the pasta and we did not consider that your fault. We did not request a refill for the salade and when we asked for a refill for the pepsi, the waitress was so rude and said that she will charge us with another pepsi as we are too althought i did not drink from my husband's drink and she said that she has already refilled it once. We said no we did not want pepsi we just need to pay so the waitress said that she will help us use the machine for the card althought we can use it ourselves but she did that to pay tips but when we did not add tips she became angry and took the card out of the machine so the payment was not completed. She said that she will use it in the main machine althought it was her fault.  That is my last visit to this place as althought she saw that we did not eat our food, she insisted to make us angry with the talk about pepsi and the tips.  Second update: when i checked our bank account, i found that they added 5 dollars tip without my permission althought i said to the waitress that we would not add tip but she did.

The food portion seems very small yet again no offer for cheese. He never came by to see if we needed drink refill.  When it was time to pay then he stuck around.  Watching me constantly as I used the kiosk to pay. Telling me specific how the ""tip"" option worked. I told him I was aware but he insisted on standing there watching me which made me a little uncomfortable. AGAIN I GOT THE FEELING I WAS BEING RUSHED.  Anyway overall the experience was nothing to write home about but enough for me to not write a great review.  Also if you go to this location,  depending on the time or day you go, finding a parking space may be a challenge  .even though they have a parking lot. So give yourself extra time.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,92-10 59th Ave

The staff were very friendly and polite I have no complaints about them at all. I ordered egg plant parmigiana  with pasta.  When it came out the pasta was very under cooked, and the egg plant was 3 slices very very thin breaded and fried and probably was frozen then popped into a microwave. The inside had all but disappeared and it was topped with a tablespoon of a thick tomato paste and 2 little strips of cheese. It was awful, and the skin from the egg plant was almost like leather.

15851,4,44,Italian,2,02/18/2023,"First time visiting this particular store on a early Saturday afternoon (445pm). However, unsure if I’ll visit again if service doesn’t change/improve. Upon entry there were 2 host, but, only one acknowledged our presence (Jacina sp??); 5 adults 1 toddler. Not being a stickler but they were literally talking to each other moments before we spoke so that just seemed strange to me. The attentive host led us to our table and then proceeded to locate a kids chair. A chair was eventually located on the other side of the restaurant. Our server, Sayed, showed up about 10-minutes later after we were sitting for a good 8-minutes. The restaurant was not overly packed or busy to separate your waiter on separate sides. We only noticed the wait once the table beside us (which sat after us) received their drinks order and was now going to order their meal. And we were still waiting for a waiter. Later in the evening after receiving our appetizer and waiting on our entrees we needed water. However, Sayed, was on the other side of the restaurant dealing with his other tables. He later explained he has other tables on the other side of the restaurant thus the dining issues. This explained his tardiness, however, as a service entity why do this to your waitress /waiter & customer(s). Hence my earlier statement regarding his apologies for his lack of attention.    As far as food goes it was a significant quantity for a medium sized average male. But the appetizers/food quality could be better. Our sticks for the dip were overly fried (brown) that most were hard. Then the raviolis’ were fried a little longer than needed. Making the exterior hard but not cement like.    This is Olive Garden and I know it’s not fast food or real Italian. Nonetheless, it’s a meal that should appease my appetite and sight.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1684 Shore Pkwy

15854,7,44,Italian,4,03/20/2023,"The waitress, Diana, was incredibly sweet even though my table was a bit needy. Although the service was fantastic, as usual, not everybody enjoyed the food. I had ordered the chicken parmigiana which was great, my brother had the children’s pizza, fries and grapes. For the last dish, we ordered the sirloin with fettuccine. My brother enjoyed the food and I enjoyed mine, however, the steak tasted like blood.        not in the good way and it was undercooked compared to how it was ordered. The chicken and gnocchi soup appetizers were amazing as well, although the portions were small. The bread sticks tasted fresh, so naturally we had another basket full. I had gotten an email for a free dessert or appetizer which the waitress accepted, so we also got a free dessert which was also splendid. Overall, the food could use some improvements (or maybe it was just that cut of steak that was ordered) but the service is wonderful.

The watermelon sangria was sooo good! Olive Garden typically have wonderful mixed drinks and cocktails.

Another 15 for the breadstick dipping sauce. Still no drinks (not even water!) on the table at this point. Had to remind our server that we ordered drinks with our food. The food itself was decent and exactly what you would expect from an Olive Garden.

They gave us a 10-15 minute wait and was seated within that time frame. We were offered a sample red wine which was a nice surprise. For the appetizer we ordered the loaded pasta chips and the mains the shrimp scampi and chicken parmesian. The food was delicious and they gave us a lot of bread sticks. The only thing I didn't like it took a lot longer than it should to take our leftovers to go. But it was most likely due to the huge crowd.

15917,70,44,Italian,1,11/20/2022,"Sadly the service and quality has gotten so bad over the past few months at this location that I had to update this review from two years ago and give this place only one star instead of five. I don't understand what happened. The staff used to be so professional, that is until a month ago or so.    My first bad experience was back in October. My Mom and I went here for dinner and we waited nearly 30 minutes just for a server to come to our table and take our drink order. Then to make matters worse, we waited an additional hour and a half for our entrees because supposedly the kitchen ran out of lasagna and we were told that in order to replenish stock, it was going to take an hour to cook or whatever. Yet in the past that was never the case. We complained to the manager and all he did was give us a half hearted apology and asked if we just wanted to cancel which I felt was quite dismissive given the fact that we come here quite often and secondly we waited patiently for so long. Overall it took  over two hours for us just to have our meals and then pay the check.    Yet we decided to give this location another chance a week ago and sadly, it was more of the same nonsense. Again we waited a long time for a server to come to our table and take our order. Then we waited nearly an hour for our food because this time, the kitchen supposedly ran out of soup and therefore had to remake more. By the time I received my soup, it was watery and bland which tells me that it was rushed without any further care. Even the salad my Mom ordered wasn't the same which she told me didn't taste fresh at all. However the entrees were fine. Upon getting ready to pay the check, my Mom asked our server if we can place an additional take out order to bring back home for a family member but we were told that because the kitchen was backed up, we'd have to wait another 30 minutes or more. Yet the strange part, the restaurant wasn't even close to being packed with customers. Thus we just decided to pay and leave instead.    Btw, it turns out that we weren't the only ones that received poor service on this particular evening. Another customer at a nearby table who overheard my Mom and I voice our displeasure, told us that he too wasn't happy either because of the two hour wait he endured just to eat and pay. Again the restaurant wasn't even close to being packed so there should have been no excuse as to why there was a delay. That being said, we're definitely not coming back ever again.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1684 Shore Pkwy
15918,71,44,Italian,1,09/21/2022,"Service was terrible!  It all began when our waiter could not take our order:  Instead of non-Ice juice we got one iced juice;  Instead, or red wine we got white wine;  Instead of bottle we got a glass of wine;  Changing order was taking forever;  We never saw our server after she took our order  later when they finally decided to bring that bottle of wine, they gave me another bottle that cost more almost twice than I asked;  When I talked about this, they told me that they can't fix THEIR problem because we ""already opened the bottle"" (the one that they got WRONG);  Later when we were going to leave and wanted to see ANY waiter beside our, of course, everybody was busy as hell.  You know, I was in 111 Bar & cafe, they got one room for 10 tables and only 2 employees in it (waiter and busboy), even in busy days like Friday (and there are about 5 people for their little dining room). And serving is 300% better, fast orders, nice waiters that are really wanting to please you and deserve some tips.

Do you guys pay attention to who you hire. You guys were doing well I don’t know what happen and it’s one situation like this that will ruin it for you, I can only imagine how many other families he forced a tip on.

Full disclosure, I am a long time fan of Olive Garden and my husband and my first date was at a Olive Garden and we have had many returns to many different locations. The food served tonight would have cemented my never returning if it was my first experience. Breadsticks were toasty and well seasoned but stale, the soup was hot enough but the sausage bits was more mushy than what I remember. All in all those little things would never have been brought up had the main which was the chicken marsala not been so offensive. I was sharing it with my toddler so started by cutting up the chicken into small pieces. While I was cutting it, noticed the chicken was cutting weird...so I ate a piece and the texture was so off. Def not like chicken meat should be. The meat was this weird bouncy consistency which was off putting. Then I took a big bite of the spaghetti and the sauce tasted bitter with an unidentifiable tang. I have maybe returned meals as being inedible all of 2 times in my life. This was the 2nd. Good thing I had ordered my kid French fries which he ate while waiting for the main because neither him nor I were going to eat any.    With all that said, my servers was great. She was attentive, upbeat and as it was a busy night told us the mains would take a bit longer to get out...which now that I think about it, my main wasn't even hot. The plate was hot but the food was just warm.    The servers for the surrounding tables were just as courteous and tried to be as accommodating as possible and transparent to the other guests from what I could hear and see. The hostess at the hostess counter were also very nice.    Not sure if I'd go back to this location. Would be willing to give Olive Garden another try at another location but more likely than not at this one again.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1684 Shore Pkwy

The experience was very pleasant, the service by our waiter was great, kind and conscientious. The food was good, only just a slight salty. Perhaps due to so much time without guests. Time will tell. Overall, a very pleasant experience.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1684 Shore Pkwy

15967,120,44,Italian,2,05/19/2022,"Yesterday, a friend and I decided to check out the Olive Garden in Caeser's Bay after a long night of hanging out at Target. Full disclosure, we are both Italian. However, we went in with open minds, and open hearts. We were ready to accept our new Olive Garden nonnas. Because, after all, when you're here, you're family.    We were greeted with a warm welcome at the door. Family. La Famiglia. We sat down at our booth, and were immediately suctioned to a layer of goo on the seatbacks. The table was also dirty, and very sticky. The wall we were next to was caked with food. We decided not to complain because we didn't want to be difficult customers. However, we began to realize a trend with this place when we noticed the bathroom floor was shellacked with a layer of dried urine. Evidently, nothing was really getting cleaned.    Our nonna for the evening was extremely nice and helpful with our orders. He brought out our salad, which was served family style in a big bowl. The salad had a nice Italian zest to it, but seemed to be pretty old. The lettuce was wilted and brown. As my friend described it, ""this food kinda soggy."" Perhaps we should have gone with the soup. The breadsticks are no joke. They are excellent. I love some good bread. We ordered some blue juice as well, which was essentially Gatorade with a lemon garnish.    For the main course, I ordered the Eggplant Parmigiana. It wasn't great. I am trying not to be a harsh critic. I understand that I am descended from millions of generations of authentic Italian nonnas toiling away in the kitchen, crafting divine eggplant parms in the hills of Sicily. That said, it was probably about as good as the eggplant parm I was cooking when I first learned how to cook the dish. A beginner's parm, no two ways about it. It was extremely salty though, and that definitely made it less enjoyable. My friend ordered the chicken marsala, and immediately started gagging upon smelling it.  It had the aroma of a cheap, frozen chinese food TV dinner, mixed with a whopping portion of decade old grease. My friend described the chicken as a mashed up chicken patty-- similar to a high school cafeteria situation. After a few bites, he couldn't do it. He tapped out. I told him that he might be able to tell our nonna about his predicament, but he didn't want to cause a problem.    Although the food wasn't that good, and the restaurant was dirty, I had a lot of fun at this place. We found all of this stuff entertaining, and I haven't laughed that much in a while. In my younger days, I would have NEVER entered an Olive Garden. But as I've gotten older, I have become more accepting. We only get one family in this life, and we need to embrace them, flaws and all. That family is located in Caeser's Bay. It's about time you pay them a visit.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1684 Shore Pkwy
15968,121,44,Italian,5,05/19/2021,"I have never posted a review for anything - until now. Food was delicious from the salads to my steak and fettuccine. Didn't get dessert because we emptied our plates and couldn't fit another bite.  Music was light but lively, staff was great, and we were able to pay for our meal with a card on a tablet right at the table.

The waitress was very inattentive and she didnt even ask if everything was okay and never asked us if we wanted more to drink. She also never asked if we wanted dessert. I will not go back to this location anymore. When we were finished eating we asked 3 different servers for a to go box and one said with an attitude yea. We finally got them from our server then the other server we asked brought them also. Horrible staff.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1684 Shore Pkwy

Been eating at this location twice within a month, favorite meal is shrimp/ seafood Alfredo, spinach and artichoke dip with pita chips. I must say that I had the lasagna a couple times too but it came off too foodie because they use a lot of cottage cheese mixed with something else that made the meal just too heavy. However if you like cottage cheese by all means dive in...other than that the overall experience was great ",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1684 Shore Pkwy

My sister and husband went there a few weeks ago and informed me that the service was terrible. I  went last week to see for myself and she was right.  I asked for a virgin strawberry daiquiri and to make it sweet it tasted like water and no flavor at all. I ordered a second one and told them that add some strawberry flavor and a some simple syrup. Nope it came back as water with little flavor. Won't be going back there anymore.  Since I travel to New jersey every other week I eat out there,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1684 Shore Pkwy

We got our drinks with no straws and had to wait about a good 7 to 10 mins for straws. Then we got our main dishes before our appetizers. Still we had no utensils to eat.

15978,131,44,Italian,1,05/19/2022,"I haven’t been to Olive Garden for years and years. It was my sister’s idea to go here for dinner. I thought it was a great idea since I haven’t been to Olive Garden in a while. When I got there the restaurant was almost empty. I was shocked because Olive Garden is very popular restaurant. However,  we got a nice table and we’re giving the menus to look at. The waitress was rushing us to order and since I haven’t been to Olive Garden in a long time, I was having trouble understanding the menu. The waitress was very rude and avoiding answering my questions. Anyway, we decided to order our food. The waitress looked annoyed when she asked us if we want salad or soup. I asked if it comes with the food. She said yes then took our menus from us and walked away. She came back with salad and breadsticks and threw them on the table. Then she got the drinks and did same thing and threw them on the table. At this point, I was really annoyed by her actions. She also forgot to bring something so I asked the other waitress to bring it and asked that that waitress not to come back to my table because she was very rude. After a while she came back again asking if everything was ok even thou I was asked not to come back to my table. I really had a very bad experience here. I went inside the restaurant all happy and with positive energy and came out feeling so bad. I couldn’t even enjoy my food. The rest of the stuff were nice thou.

The food was great I had the chicken marsala. It was very good despite missing some mushrooms. My sister had the chicken scampi. She didn't complain about it so that is a good thing.

The waitress, Emma, was very friendly and accommodating. The only negative was that the service was a little slow because it was a busy Sunday evening and our waitress was supposed to have a helper who was not there. We weren't in a hurry so it was okay.

We came to Olive Garden expecting to have great time during our twins birthday, however instead we left extremely frustrated and disappointed. Terrible, terrible service!! The server came to our table didn't even welcome and/ or introduce herself. When she got to our table the first thing she said, ""You all ready to order?"" She took our order for drinks and appetizers. I'm still puzzled on how the appetizers came out before the bread sticks? Never mind the fact, I had to ask another server for them. My son order a Shirley Temple he didn't get any cherries, so he politely ask if he can have some. He never got any cherries until the end of the meal when he asked again. Mind you we got to Olive Garden at 6:30pm, we didn't get our food until about 8:30pm which my girlfriend's and I food order were wrong. Between all this the sever told us she was leaving and another sever will be helping us. The sever never left, she continued to take orders from other tables. When we got our food, we requested to speak to the manager. The manager comes to our table and immediately throws the server under the bus by stating that the ticket order was 22 minutes old. The food looked dry due to sitting under the heaters for a long extended time. Furthermore, the manager kept on insisting that we reorder our food and she will comp the bill. As if this is going to make our dining experience better. We did not reorder our food, we were just relieved that at least the kids were able to eat. Also not to mention the men's bathroom was a nightmare. Luckily for the server we are nice people because we still left a $20 dollar tip for terrible service.

They said that we can take my baby, who was in a car seat and slide him in the booth. Which to me  didn't seem right. So my Husband grabbed a highchair they came back and said that it's a saftey hazard and the highchair can't be near the booth we were sitting in and that they can give me another booster seat, my little on is not able to sit in a booster seat just yet. I'm sorry but that was the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. So I either had to put my infant child in my lap or back in a car seat.  We ordered drinks the soda was so watered down since they needed to refill the syrup in the soda machine. The server goes yeah we know about that you should try the Dr. Pepper or another drink. Ummm if you knew about it then why serve us it? The food was good but the service was not the greatest. The server never came by and asked if we needed anything or how everything was going, we had to flag her down.

If you’re looking for a good meal and a satisfied belly this is definitely NOT the place.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1684 Shore Pkwy
16009,165,44,Italian,5,05/19/2021,Always Enjoy my experience there. Best waitress friendly staff and management. Good Food. Social Distancing practices fully enforced. Which is more important than most people realize. My only complaints would be Menu based. Bring Back the Venetian apricot chicken. On the healthy side.I miss the Whole Wheat Angel hair pasta option. I believe they used to have a customizable appetizer option. And I seem to remember a person pizza. Either way. Highly recommended.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1684 Shore Pkwy

16011,167,44,Italian,1,05/19/2020,"Where to begin, the service was horrible. Had to wait 1 hour to be seated even though we called ahead of time and was assured the restaurant was empty. Two servers took our order then bickered about who should keep the table. I took close to 1.5 hours to receive the food. Some food arrived cold. Basically arrived at 7:30, was seated at 8:40 then food arrived close to 10pm and finally ate at 10:20pm. No curtesy was offered by the manager and there was a refusal for any discount from server/management at this location even though I never complained and patiently waited. Poor excuse for a location. The Olive Garden in Gateway Mall and the City are way better. DON’T GO TO THIS PLACE WITH A LARGE PARTY!",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1684 Shore Pkwy

I came here today January 3 with my family and the service was GREAT my server was Bianca and although she was new she was very attentive. The food today tasted as if it was a TV dinner meal. The pasta stuck together like a big clump it was way over cooked, to top it off they ran out of French fries, apple juice and ice cream.

In addition, the couple seating a few feet away were feeding their dog food. I mentioned this to the waiter. And once again the manager was no where to be seen.

My boyfriend, my brother and I were very polite! I know cuz I've been a waitress all my life and it's very hard job unless you just know what you are doing. Anyways the server just left dirty plates while we were eating. I had to stock them myself. But then at the end I only paid card for the full amount of the bill. I left cash tip. When my boyfriend wanted a another bill, the server did not have to say anything about the tip not being included. It made us feel uncomfortable and did want to leave nothing but I am not a very rude person at all. Dont know if we are coming back, wanted to bring more of my family members but if I feel uncomfortable I know my friends and family will as well. Was not welcoming but again the food is great !",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1684 Shore Pkwy

Only came here because I’ve had a gift card in my possession for 3 yrs.  the lasagna was warm but the sauce is awful, filled with oregano and overly seasoned meat. The bread is dry, looks fake and cheap. A local pizzeria makes way better food. You get what you pay for.  Funny thing, manager comes by after my meal and says, How’s your margaritas?  I replied, It’s awful.  He says, Oh, ok.  He frowns and walks away. He didn’t ask me why, or of the bar could make another. Ridiculous.

Also, we arrived a little after 6PM on a Sunday. We were told it would be 20 minutes, but they got us seated in about half that.    Our server started off attentive, got our drink order and drinks quickly. My kids' meals arrived relatively quickly as well, but 15 minutes later, they are done and I'm still awaiting mine. And our server has ignored us since serving the kids.    He just had the gall to tell me, ""Your food will be out in 2 minutes,"" like it is normal to serve kids 20 minutes before the adult.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1684 Shore Pkwy

I normally rather not be seated next to a kitchen/prep station since they’re very loud to due to orders being ordered, prepped & served. This locations kitchen entry way was very open where the staff all got together spoke loudly, dishes clanging and to boot a loud speaker voicing orders. After about 20 mins already having placed our orders since we asked to be moved to a different table that was clearly open. At this point we’ve been seated for an hour & a half w/o beverages and/or food. We kept asking waiters if it was possible for them to find out what was happening with our order.  None of the waiters were helpful. Once we were fed up with levels of ineptitude at this restaurant we got up and left the table. Now at the front of by the hostess we ask to speak to a manager which was no help @ all! I left the restaurant with 2 hungry/sleepy children.

I feel like the workers there were not really organized. They were all gathered up talking amongst each other while I am waiting for 15 min to get my check. It doesn’t make sense to me.

16031,187,44,Italian,1,05/19/2020,"Ruined my son's 18th birthday. I called in advance to make a reservation for a birthday party of 12. The person on the phone said he was a manager. He took the reservation, then asked me to also make a reservation online the day of the party and then to call to confirm the number of people over the phone, which I did. We came at the scheduled time, but they told us the wait time was up to an hour. I said ""but I made a reservation for 5pm!"" They said they don't take reservations and gave me an attitude. Nice start. It was embarrassing because there were 11 people that I invited standing next to me, refused to be seated. I asked to speak to the manager. The manager took 10 minutes to come. I explained the situation asking why they made me waste my time making me call several times and each time confirming the booking over the phone. The manager said I didn't speak to him and he can't help me. Neither him, nor the front desk employees showed any interest in fixing the situation and spoke to me with a lot of attitude. I asked if they could give me some kind of a discount to make it up for their screw-up. The 3 employees standing next to the front desk laughed in my face and one of them said ""Do you really think WE should give YOU a discount?! No!"" With even more attitude!  I turned around and left. We went to another restaurant in the area. It was not the screw-up itself, but their attitude and no interest in resolving the issue that prompted us to leave.  I have a solid reason to believe I was discriminated based on my looks because I am a white blonde, while all of the employees I was trying to get help from were people of color.  I told them they're going to get the appropriate reviews all over the web. They're not getting away with such a horrible customer service!",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1684 Shore Pkwy

Another thing was that the servers seemed very inexperienced, they kept asking different tables if they order a certain dish. On top of that! It is supposed to be unlimited soup and breadsticks but, you’ll get your soup and breadstick ever 20 minutes, so is it really unlimited?

For sure, they had all heard us but none of them said anything or even took acknowledged us at all. We stood there awkwardly waiting for somebody to take us to our table until finally, one of them told one of the other two girls standing there to take us to their table. But instead, they both walked away rudely and didn’t even bother taking us. After this, we continued waiting for somebody to take us to our table and whilst doing so, the guy standing there was acting so incredibly slowly and honestly didn’t even seem to know what he was doing. Finally, he took us to our table which was right BEHIND the opening counter so, they could’ve easily told us to sit there instead of us awkwardly waiting for somebody to acknowledge us. After we sat there, we looked at our menus and was ready to order. We even used the tablets provided to buzz for a waiter. After waiting a solid ten minutes, nobody came. Instead, all the waiters were just standing at the takeout space and talking away. They honestly didn’t even seem to care that there were customers waiting to get their food ordered. Finally, after 20 minutes, somebody came up to us and asked if anyone helped us. After, she told us she would get our waiter but that never happened. She started taking our orders but it was never the same waiter. We went through THREE waitresses before one permanently stayed (whom was very nice). In my opinion, the food overall wasn’t even worth the wait. We had ordered the chicken alfredo fried bites but it’s was honestly just a disappointment. It was pure oil and didn’t even taste like chicken or alfredo.

16065,221,44,Italian,3,08/22/2022,I can't call Olive Garden an Italian restaurant but there fettuccine alfredo with chicken is delicious.  The wait staff is nice but not very attentive.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1684 Shore Pkwy
16066,222,44,Italian,3,05/19/2020,"I gave it 5 stars only because they just opened up and have no experience  yet. Everything is excellent, except extremely slow service!!! They must work on it. My family and I love Olive Garden! We're very excited that we finally have one so close to us!!! This location is new. The restaurant is beautiful, the food is delicious, very friendly staff. I love it!!! However, we went there Tuesday evening, there were 4 of us and we had to wait 40 mins just to be seated. Then my husband had to wait another 20 mins to get a bottle of beer, this is just the beginning and an example of how long your order takes. It's a BOTTLE, all they had to do is open it, imagine how long it took to get our food! If it took so long on Tuesday evening, how long would it take on the weekend? I really hope they'll quickly correct this problem. I will make updates, the way it is now I wouldn't give it more than 2 stars!  Time is very valuable to most people. There is another location in Brooklyn, but this is exactly the reason why we never went there, as when we tried we were told that there is at least 45 mins wait just to be seated. It's faster for us to drive to Long Island location and that's exactly what we were doing until now. Update: Came back today (6/9/19), changed to 3 stars. Waiting time is way too long.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1684 Shore Pkwy
16067,223,44,Italian,4,05/19/2022,"The food was delicious, price reasonable, however the hostess was rude. How do you greet someone with a question of whether they have their vaccine card or not, rather than ""hi welcome!, are you dinning in????",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1684 Shore Pkwy
16068,224,44,Italian,2,05/19/2020,"I've been there twice since its opening. 1st time we went it was a 45 min wait and not because it was busy, there were at least more than 2 dozen open tables. It was simply because they were under staffed. It was fine, we sat at the bar and took advantage of there half priced glasses of wine while we waited for our table. Once seated and served, there was a bit of a lackluster with the server coming back and asking if we needed anything more. (The table did the unlimited soup and salad) We had to keep asking for our server for more.    The 2nd time was just recent. My gf and I walked in and it was graduation day so every table was almost filled. But, to our surprise, no wait at all for a table. We sat down and it took 10 mins for someone to acknowledge us, and 30 mins before we even got any water or silverware. Then when we ordered our soup and salad, we had to ask for another plate because we were given just one and the server looked as if we were asking for a pot of gold. Like we were supposed to eat salad off of one dish between the two of us. We asked for marinara sauce for dipping the breadsticks. That never came. We asked for cheese for our soup and salad, that never came. This place is very poorly trained, very understaffed, and the staff they do have do not know how to manage their time and handle tables and service more efficiently. My gf and I almost walked out twice. Until this is fixed, I cant see myself going to that location anymore. As convenient as it is cos its local, I'd rather get better service in the city.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1684 Shore Pkwy

I didnt get water until I asked for it 1 hour after being seated. We weren't offered cheese for the pasta or the salad. Disappointed. The food tasted great despite the wait.

The wait was less than 10 minutes,  the ladies bathroom was clean and the men's had no paper towels to wipe hands with. Sat down and after 10-15 minutes later a server came for just our drinks and we ordered appetizers from the kiosk at the table. Only half the drinks arrived and 45 minutes later was my beverage from the bar brought after asking the whole time. Took about 30 minutes to receive salad and was given the appetizers we ordered with our dinner and the were cold.  I literally had to ask for water cause beverage from bar never arrived until we were almost done with our meals. Then a watered down melted frozen drink came, it sat at the bar probably 40 minutes. No one knows what they are doing. Maybe after 6 months if still open will possibly try again, this was evey table btw everyone complaining.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1684 Shore Pkwy

My family and I were excited that an this place opened up in our neighborhood and wanted to give it a chance. BIG MISTAKE!!! We were seated in a corner, where servers passed us by without any acknowledgement. After 15 mins at the table I was able to grab the attention of a worker. She was very helpful in trying to find out who was supposed to take care of our table. She kept asking who is serving table 214? Once she found Joshua, she asked him to attend to us, he gave an uninterested look and walked away. At this point we got up to leave. The young woman asked us not to leave, she would find a manager, and we could receive a discount.

The person on the phone can’t hear me because the girl in the back is talking loudly over her. Then she screams over to her manager about my refund and puts me on a 2 second hold and tells me to call my bank.

16077,234,44,Italian,2,05/19/2020,"Came here the other day on a weekday for a table of 2, restaurant seemed pretty empty and we still had to wait for a table for about 20 mins or so.  As we got seated we looked through the menu and ordered our food.  We ordered ‘Tour of Italy’ (Chicken Parmigiana, Lasagna Classico and our signature Fettuccine Alfredo), and also got an order of ‘Chicken Alfredo’ (Sliced grilled chicken and our signature, homemade alfredo sauce over fettuccine pasta).  We ordered an order of calamari as an appetizer.  We got the calamari about 15 mins later, it came in the tiniest version of calamari itself, you could barely even see it was on the plate as the waitress brought it to us, basically bunch on gar****, tasteless and looked like some leftovers of the real portion.  Anyways.. we got the salad a few mins after the calamari as well, it was actually pretty good.  Then about 15 mins passes, the waitress said that your food is coming out shortly.  Waited another 10 mins still no entrees, 20, 25 mins pass still nothing, we basically waited for about another 35 mins until we asked about our orders.  It finally arrived a few mins later, the food tasted amazing but at that point it’s like we already waited so long and not in the best mood honestly.  All a while the restaurant was just emptying as we waited not getting busier as you’d expect when your order takes forever to come.  Overall experience is just blahhh.  They 100% are just short on staff in the kitchen and are too cheap to hire more workers.  The wait to be seated and for the food is outrageously    LOOOOOOOOOOONNNGGGGGGGG !!!!!!

The event came with one appetizer for the table and one entree per person. Non-alcoholic drinks were included too. Since it was their first day the food wasn't has close to a normal olive garden in taste. The calamari seemed a bit small. The broccoli were over cooked, mushy. The soup was a bit salty. But I think they will be fine once they officially open on April 8th. I believe the event is going on for Saturday and Sunday before opening.

16084,241,44,Italian,2,05/19/2020,"The food certainly gets 2 stars - but the waiter (Carlos) gets 5 for sure!  The dining experience was very mediocre, as was the food.  The AC in the restaurant was practically non-existent, it was freakin' HOT in there.  My mother and I both ordered the unlimited soup, salad and breadsticks, and we also ordered the fried calamari.  The soup (minestrone) was so salty it was barely edible.  The salad was even saltier, which is mind blowing.  We are guessing it was the Italian dressing that was on the salad that was extremely salty, but either way - the dressing was on the salad already.  We didn't have a choice about that, or at least was not asked if we wanted dressing on the salad or on the side.   The bill was almost $50, which included a big tip, because our waiter was on point.  Carlos was attentive, friendly and kept checking on us to see if we needed anything.  Sadly, the food flopped big-time!  He gave us 3 breadsticks to take home, yep, too salty as well.  But for soup and salad that was too salty to even eat, the price was just ridiculous.  Overall, we most likely will not be going back.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1684 Shore Pkwy

It was surprisingly fresh and the batter was extremely crispy, and paired along with the sauce was just a heavenly combination!    Of course the unlimited breadsticks and side salad were great as well and they were very generous on the cheese both on the salad and the entrees. My personal favorite was the shrimp scampi.

But this one in Manhattan the food was terrible. The salad I was served it had the bottom brown part of the lettuce as u can see I marked red circle in the picture. Also it tasted funny. Like it wasnt fresh. The Shrimp, Chicken Carbonara pasta was not creamy. It was completely dry food like it was made yesterday and was reheated. My cousins parmesian chicken was completely overcooked. The waiter we had was very slow in a slow business day. He would take his long time to bring food and the check later. I have never had any bad experiences w Olive Garden till I went this one. It literally ruin our day.

Server never checked in on us and never asked how any of the food was. Empty dishes were left on our table and not picked up. Server acted like she would rather do anything than be at work.    Terrible experience- would not recommend.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,2 Times Sq

16851,23,50,Italian,2,05/19/2022,"The staff were friendly and the breadsticks were delicious. However, my British taste buds were not a fan of the rest of the food. My salad was drowning in dressing and my husband and I both could only pick at our mains. By the time they reached us, we'd already filled up on soup, salad and breadsticks. However, I also found my main (chicken alfredo) to be horrendously rich and it just tasted like pasta covered in cream, which was sickening. I mainly ate the chicken off the top, which was quite bland and disappointing. Very expensive for what it was, although I have found all restaurants in America to be shockingly expensive, particularly after tax and tip.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,2 Times Sq
16852,24,50,Italian,4,05/19/2022,This is a really big Olive Garden that’s very clean. I went here for lunch around 3:00 and there was no lines and lots of empty tables. The staff is very friendly and the prices aren’t bad. They tell you how much you must tip which is the only downside to going here. I would recommend going here but don’t if you don’t want to be forced to pay a tip.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,2 Times Sq

16855,27,50,Italian,5,04/19/2023,"Today (27th March) was my first time visiting Olive Garden. I ordered a Spaghetti & Meatballs to share with my partner. It came with a soup and breadsticks.    First off, the meatballs were mostly made out of bread crumbs and the sauce was too sweet; however the pasta was nicely al dente. Secondly, the chicken gnocci soup was insanely salty, I had to dilute it with water to make it edible. The breadsticks were AMAZING!!!    Despite the food not being the best, 5 stars to this Olive Garden as our server was so sweet. Her name is Sydney and she was very attentive. I mentioned that I really liked the chocolates and asked if I could get a few more. She returned to my table with a to-go cup filled with chocolates!

Olivia who was taking care of our table was so disrespectful and nasty with us that it does not make sense why this restaurant has hired a person with 0 customer service.

Where we are from Nova Scotia we didn’t receive a text as it was long distance but we went back and a table was ready.  The food was super quick to get to us and delicious.

The food was lovely, however as we were heading out a man approached us and said we hadn't left a tip, and that we didn't leave a tip the last time we were there a few weeks ago and asked if anything was wrong. Our server had also said he recognised us and said we were here a few weeks before. We said to both that we had only arrived in NYC yesterday, however the man on the way out became very aggressive and said he had CCTV footage of us from a few weeks back. We said we had left a tip, tried to walk out but he wouldn't move out of our way. After a few minutes of going round in circles, he finally let us through. We spoke to the concierge in our hotel who advised this was not normal, and that tips are not mandatory but greatly appreciated. Safe to say we will not be returning while we're on our trip. Disgraceful that they let people like this into the restaurant building.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,2 Times Sq
16879,53,50,Italian,2,04/19/2023,"We had mixed feelings today during our visit at Olive Garden. First, we didn't have to queue when we arrived (we were on the online waiting list), which is good. Unfortunately, the waiter was not caring at all. He was throwing the food/drinks we ordered on the table. After asking if the air conditioning could be decreased (it was super cold), nothing happened. When we paid, he took our credit card and walked away. During that time, he billed another costumer. It looked like he forgot ours. Only after asking, we got the credit card back. Overall, the food was not too bad but the service can be improved a lot.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,2 Times Sq

After an hour long wait and still no call, we came inside and they decided to seat us. 20 minutes after being sat down, the waitress finally came to the table with over priced menus in hand. For the exact same food that can be eaten anywhere else in US, they up-charged the entire menu 10-fold. Appetizers were ordered, yet they came out the same time as the food, and waitress neglected the staple of Olive Garden (the cheese grating). Our glasses sat empty until we asked for refills, service was terrible. The only 5 star review this restaurant deserves is being the worst Olive Garden I’ve ever been too.

I waited 20 min down stairs, which is not an issue because it was busy hour but while I went 3rd floor and asked hostage she wanted me to wait. I waited and saw more white people coming and being seated. I got mad. It was horrible experience. May be I am Asian and I was treated bad. I don’t know. Later, when I talked with hostage why we are being kept waiting and others are being seated. She asked my name and a guy took us for a table. I waited like 15 minute more and watched other people behind me getting help. My birthday dinner was ruined because of this bad experience. I will never be back in this location.

Then he forgot me after some time he came back and told they had no ginger ale so I ordered a coke! After we almost finished eating my drink came.... Again with ice....

16887,61,50,Italian,1,02/18/2023,"WORST experience ever. I don’t usually write reviews but i’m outraged and upset so feel the need to warn others about my terrible experience. First time visiting new York, my boyfriends birthday wanted to dine out for a few nights and make it special. Went to Olive gardens with high hopes but left with disgust. Firstly, staff are so rude and rushed us at every step. the food was so so overpriced, and it was so tasteless and dry. the plates and cutlery were sticky and dirty, the cup had fingerprints and food at the bottom. Our food came all at the same time, even though we specifically asked for starter first ( as is usually standard), our waiter spoke barely any words to us and if he did they were blunt and he was almost angry. The food was disgusting, flavourless and dry. Have you ever eaten a lasagna that tasted like soggy cardboard? well neither had i until tonight. After all of this they had the audacity to give us the bill with a compulsory 18% service charge tip…we considered contacting the police regarding this robbery!! why would i tip for the worst service and food i’ve ever had in my life? our waiter didn’t communicate with us he wanted to take our card to a separate back room to charge it. So a forced tip of 18%?? we didn’t even eat our food we couldn’t stomach it yet with our luck the food we did eat will probably leave us with food poisoning as all the other reviews have. Not to mention all the waiters and staff just sitting around on their phones looking like they aren’t even at work. this place is a joke and has been the worst part of our trip to nYC",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,2 Times Sq

Olive garden across the country has always been exceptional for gluten allergy purposes, but this visit at time Square went above and beyond. To start, our food was fast, delicous, and accurate. But the better part was at the end of our meal. We tend to skip out on birthday desserts most places due to a lack of GF options, but our server, Delilah, was determined to get me something for my birthday. She came back out with a plate FULL of yummy fresh fruits and some dipping sauces (caramel, chocolate and whipped cream), with even a CANDLE in the whipped cream so I could still get sung to like they do typically with cake for birthdays.

I came here for lunch, they said it will be 20 mins till I get table, after around 35 mins I got my table, I don’t mind waiting but the server was very lost, I requested table next to window so he asked the lady at desk, she was very rude, she said  it’s the only one available, we don’t have anymore tables but I saw quite a few tables available so I asked about that, she said we are not serving in that area, there were people in that area, who just got there. I settled at the table they gave me, the waiter came and asked if I want drink or something….He was in rush, didn’t even give me menu, and no hello or anything… I asked him about the house wine, he just got the glass with little wine to try and placed it there, and ran away before I can ask what kind of wine is this. He kept me waiting 20 mins till he came to ask me for my order, in between that, I tried calling the waitresses/waiters who passed by, but no one responded.. the waiter finally showed up but by that time I was fed up, I told him I am tired of waiting he said ok and went to other table. No sorry or please or anything…. I asked the person at desk if I could talk to the manager or their supervisor- one person came after 5-10 mins I told him what happened- he also didn’t say sorry or anything- just asked if I want to still have lunch there…. I was really angry so I left. They didn’t have decency or humility- I understand people are busy and it can take long time some days - but no one there had common curtesy or anything.

The Alfredo was a hit for the both of us! The chicken Parmesan and lasagne was okay but I kept going back to the Alfredo! The house salad was nice and not too filling. Breadsticks were hard to swallow, but overall I found it to be a great experience! Our server was lovely and helped us figure out tipping as we’re from Australia and don’t have that system. It also started snowing midway through our meal which made for amazing scenery while we ate.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,2 Times Sq

The guy who sat us could not have missed that putting the napkins & utensils down at the table  The croutons in the salad were stale . The soup was overly seasoned & barely hot when brought out. We ordered minestrone & have had it at olive gardern before & this looked like pasta fagioli & the waitress insisted it was minestrone but clearly was not. The chicken alfredo was the only plate that was decent. This is the second time I have gone to Olive Garden & has been very disappointing.

The grilled chicken was sparse over the ravioli and the sauce didn't hit. It starts at 12 and the toppings make it more depending on the selection.

The first combination of paste and sauce(fettuccine+ Alfredo sauce +chicken fritte) came in a decent portion. Since I wanted to try different combinations, I ordered rigatoni + creamy mushroom sauce in the next turn, this time the portion was small(of course understandable), but I felt that they just boiled pasta and added cold sauce to it , which was not what I expected. They could have informed well ahead how the ""never ending works"". The difference between the first and second serving was drastic.

16986,163,50,Italian,1,07/23/2022,"We were really disappointed with our whole experience here in almost all aspects.  -Firstly we arrived and they said it would be a 20 minute wait so took my name and number down, we literally stepped out of the restaurant and no more than 2 minutes later the restaurant text to say our table was ready.  -We went up and were taken to our seats, except the server somehow got lost and we ended up doing a lap of the restaurant before she sat us somewhere  -Ordering took forever and the food was so basic when it arrived, I'm vegan and there was only 2 options.  -My sisters napkin was dirty when she unwrapped her cutlery and it took a very long time to get it replaced.  -After we got the bill, we waited and waited but our server didnt come back, we had somewhere to be so we asked another server to check our bill so we could leave and they said no?!

Anyhow, the wait staff are automatically tipped at this particular location.. therefore, he was horrible server. He was very inattentive. What it was is that he didn’t want to bring refills of the soup, salad, or drinks. One soup.. one small salad bowl to share.. and one drink. We just sat there waiting. I was on vacation therefore I did not want to get upset/confrontational. So we just chose to leave. I realized the issue when the bill arrived. He was tipped a large amount naturally without having to earn it. It stated that it can be altered which I did and the waiter did not choose to accept that. When I arrived home, I checked my bank and noticed he kept the high tip for himself rather than inputting the amount I put on the receipt I signed. Very dishonest server!!! As usual, the food was good.. there just needs to be accountability with the ethics of the wait staff.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,2 Times Sq

17002,179,50,Italian,4,05/19/2022,"Overall, our Olive Garden dining experience was enjoyable.  We struggled a little bit to find the entrance but that was just because we were tourists and Google Maps led us astray.  After getting some directions from a hotel employee, we felt silly and realized the entrance was actually very easy to find.  After our vaccination checks, we were seated immediately with no wait at a clean table.  Our waitress had hot bread sticks ready for us and got our drink order quickly.  After ordering our food it came out quickly and was hot.  My marinara and cheese dip seemed to have a soapy taste to it but it was the first time I've tried it so that may be expected for the dish.  I didn't like it and chose not to eat it.  The waitress was quick with soup and drink refills and was adequately polite but was a little slow bringing us our check.  After eating until we were full, a little extra time in a chair was barely a negative though.  Altogether, I think this was the Olive Garden experience that I would expect and we were both happy with our meals overall.    Diner beware though: an 18% gratuity is included on your check.  You do get the option to tip more or less(via a negative tip) if you choose.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,2 Times Sq

He is a xenophobic person who treats really bad some people. When we arrived he asked us what we want to order with a really bad attitude. When we asked him for some of our plates he responds angry and in a very bad way. He gave us a plate of food with a hair on it!! He only treats well the ladies but is a really aggressive person with men. When the check arrived, we told him we would give the tip in cash, he charged the check + the massive suggested tip of 18% and then SHOUTED me to give him the tip in cash!!  When I gave it to him he threw the ticket to the table very angry!! That’s not acceptable for any kind of customer. He has no treat with people and should not be in that position. Now I read the opinions here in google i see it’s not the first time someone has a bad experience with this man. Please if you go to Olive Garden Times Square do not let JUAL A to be your waiter if you don’t want to have a really bad experience. We are never going back to that restaurant because of him.

17016,193,50,Italian,1,06/23/2022,"Any other location, and I might have considered 2 stars. I'm in the heart of Times Square, so I expected at least a bare minimum of quality on everything (since the prices are several dollars more than any other location I've been to). This was a Tuesday evening that did not appear overly busy.  Our waiter disappeared after our initial round of drinks. The salad lettuce was wilted and overly chopped. The bread was overcooked and tasted stale. the fried ravioli was straight -up burnt. Half of the baked ziti pasta was undercooked shells. the dishes seemed like they weren't cleaned well (see picture). When the waiter finally did come back to check on us, he seemed a bit rude (it looked like he was assigned primarily to the bar so maybe he was mad we didn't order alcohol, maybe he's having a bad day?). Overall, poor experience. Again, I've been to Olive Gardens I'm other states, so I thought one in one of the most touristed cities in the world, it would at least be a decent Olive Garden experience.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,2 Times Sq

We had a waiter who was waiting like a vulture for us to write down our change of tip amount, even going as far as talking to a colleague and pointing at us very obviously. The food was average - very salty - and the service was bordering on hostile. Snappy attitude and, as mentioned, making it very obvious that we were being talked about for no reason by literally pointing at us and staring.

As for the food: it was great. Bread sticks never disappoint unlike the cardboard sticks at Applebee's. Salad was good and plentiful. My chicken alfredo was decent and cheese ravioli was great.

17070,248,50,Italian,5,05/20/2019,"First time at Olive Garden did not disappoint.  Ravioli di Portobello was wonderful,  with juicy mushroom bits inside and flavorful cheesy sun-dried tomato sauce on outside. My friend enjoyed Chicken Giardino to the last bite too. Just what was needed on this cold day. The only regret was that we were too full to try any dessert... Will have to come back",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,2 Times Sq
17071,249,50,Italian,2,06/23/2022,"Food arrives quickly, salad and breadsticks ars on the house. Other than that not much positive to tell. Food looked like it had been left under a heat lamp for a whole day and tasted like it. Staff was rude and short.

It is very expensive for what it is but you are paying to be in Times Square! A kitschy fun experience I'm glad I had.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,2 Times Sq
17074,252,50,Italian,3,08/22/2022,A bit worse for the wear... Indeed it could seriously use an update in decore. Tired and threadbare. Not what one would expect from a time's square Olive Garden. Lacking in ambiance. Food was so-so. Service was spectacular.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,2 Times Sq
17075,253,50,Italian,4,08/22/2022,"Good place to eat in the heart of the city. It's like every other Olive Garden.  Check out the actual waiting time at their website and put yourself on the waiting list, to avoid waiting in front of the restaurant. You're not allowed to wait inside.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,2 Times Sq

17079,257,50,Italian,1,07/23/2022,Came for dinner with family. I chose the unlimited soup salad and breadsticks. My items came within 10 mins. I finished my soup and the waiter came back after 30 mins and asked if I wanted another soup and if the family wanted a refill the drinks and salad. We said yes. We waited another 45 mins for my second soup and the salad and drink refills. No refill on the ice tea or salad. Absolutely not the server's fault. They are understaffed.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,2 Times Sq
17080,258,50,Italian,1,05/19/2022,This is Olive Gardens in Time Square. There was 7 of us dining. Our server didn’t ever come back to check on us whether we want refill for our drinks or if we needed anything else. Service was extremely poor and it wasn’t even busy at that time. It was impossible just to get an empty plate so we can eat our calamari that we ended up helping ourselves to some stacked up small plates we saw on the hall. Our server recommended the seafood carbonara and showed us the photo of it on the menu so I did get that only to find out it didn’t look like the photo. It was so plain and lacking in flavor. It was so simple I would have made it so much better at home with a pre made sauce in a jar from the grocery store. It didn’t taste nor look like carbonara. It was a waste of money dining here. The food wasn’t enjoyable. The service even made it worst. You can’t even get a refill to your iced tea or lemonade. Or even get a plate to eat on!,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,2 Times Sq

17082,0,51,Italian,4,05/19/2022,"Arrived and didn’t have to wait, they had plenty of tables and booths available for seating.  If you have a larger party then there might be a wait as we saw a few people waiting that had more than 4 family members.  Service was good and the waiter made sure to check up on us the entire time we were there.  The drinks were made as expected and enough kick to give my wife a buzz.  Food was above average, main course was not too salty and came out tasking fresh.  The shrimp and chicken was cooked perfectly.  Not dry or undercooked.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1317 Centennial Ave
17083,1,51,Italian,4,05/19/2022,"We absolutely love this place. My kids actually love the food and now we try to visit every 2 weeks. I do have few concerns and hence the rating.  The concern I have is that they have change the Lasagna Fritta sauce from marinara to meat sauce and didn't update the menu.  Second concern is the cocktail drinks I had tried Italian Rum Punch & Amaretto Sour, they barely have any liquor in it. Its just a virgin fruity drink. Please fix the menu or make the drink as it should have been.  Their service and servers are amazing. Never had an issue regarding that.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1317 Centennial Ave
17084,2,51,Italian,5,05/19/2022,"We went there yesterday, on a packed Saturday night, and the service was great! The wait time was 25 minutes for a party of four, which wasn't that bad at peak time (7pm). Our server was great though. He got out all of our orders within the first 30 minutes despite it being a full house, and the food was great! Also, he took credit for his mistake for mixing up my order, and got the correct food out promptly. Everything tasted amazing and I would definitely come back to this location!",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1317 Centennial Ave
17085,3,51,Italian,4,05/19/2022,This resturant is just ok.  The atomosphere could be alittle more inviting.  A plus you get an all you can eat salad with your meal.  I had the chicken cutlets with spagehti. It was good say a4 out of 5.  My wife had the shrimp scampi and she enjoyed it.  It comes with breadsticks as well.  I had the peach iced teach and the flavor was too sweet and not enough peach flavor.  I wouldn't get that again.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1317 Centennial Ave
17086,4,51,Italian,4,10/21/2022,"I haven’t been to an Olive Garden in over 20 years, and after tonight’s dinner I wish I didn’t wait so long!  I ordered the giant cheese stuffed shells for dinner, and it came with a salad and breadsticks.  That’s a great deal!  The salad was excellent!  The lettuce was fresh and crisp, and the salad dressing was so tasty!  The breadsticks were very good!  I chose the 5 cheese dipping sauce to dip my breadsticks in.  The sauce was very good, but I prefer dipping breadsticks in oil.  I’ll ask if I can get oil with the bread sticks next time.  The giant cheese stuffed shells were DELICIOUS!!!!   I highly recommend trying that dish.  For dessert I had the brownie lasagna which was very good!  I enjoyed my dinner so much that I’m planning on dining at Olive Garden again soon!  I recommend Olive Garden in Piscataway!",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1317 Centennial Ave
17087,5,51,Italian,3,08/22/2022,I think they give the old food to Take Out and Delivery customers. The lasagna was old (look at the ricotta cheese in the pic). Can’t complain about the fettuccine because it seemed fresh and the kids finally ate something beside Go-gurts.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1317 Centennial Ave
17088,6,51,Italian,5,01/19/2023,"Wow !!!    So this is my second visit at this Olive Garden on centennial ave in Piscataway and I have yet to be disappointed..  I find it ironic that they are literally next-door sharing the same parking lot and everything with TGI Fridays and yet,  the drastic differences in the food and customer service are astounding. I ordered a chicken Alfredo, chicken gnocchi soup and a shrimp and chicken tortellini which  would pit a lot of other establishments to shame. The food was amazing and very reasonably priced for the high quality and portions we received. I find it amazing despite having a packed house that the staff was able to navigate car side service, seating dine in patrons , and also servicing those of us that were paying for 2 go orders , all without allowing there entrance be to congested with foot traffic and waiting patrons….. the Customer service I received here gave me confidence that I did not have to double check my order before leaving. Even with the consistent flow of diners;  Olive Garden’s car side service also moved very quickly and smoothly. I waited maybe 15 minutes for my Order and in that time I had four vehicles come and go in the parking space beside me , that were receiving there food which kept the flow of traffic into the lot nowhere near crowded for the amount of customers they had. I am still amazed and will definitely be back.    **To the management team in charge of the waitstaff at this location, well done !!! ….    * Your team deserves to be recognized *",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1317 Centennial Ave
17089,8,51,Italian,4,03/20/2023,The server was super nice and catered to our big table well.

17091,10,51,Italian,4,05/19/2022,"This was a good visit! Eric took great care of us, and I noticed that he was working multiple sections at the same time. The only issue of the night was the calamari (which is our favorite) being undercooked and rubbery. The soup was amazing, as always, and the salad was very good tonight. I ordered the Tour of Italy, like I usually do, and it was prepared to perfection last night. I'm usually not a fan of lasagna, but this one had me ready to go through an entire pan! The Fettuccine Alfredo was creamy and delicious tonight. I was most impressed by the Chicken Parmigiana tonight, as this is my favorite Italian dish. This makes it much harder to impress me, and this one certainly did! Good food and great service! I highly recommend going here, and ask for Eric!",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1317 Centennial Ave

And as we were getting our cash together to tip the server. she kept coming up to us telling us gratuity wasn't included, and saying she lives off tips. Usually we tip over 20% and were planning to that day, she just kept coming up to us almost begging for tips. We felt extremely awkward because we were going to tip her, she was jus guilt tripping us for not tipping when she wanted us too. We still tipped her, but it made our experience kinda awkward ngl",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1317 Centennial Ave
17096,15,51,Italian,1,05/13/2023,That’s nice u didn’t have to wait. But this is not the case for everyone. Theyve had times especially holidays where there was over an hr wait. Olive Garden is a restaurant or am I mistaken. Call up can’t make reservations. That’s not a restaurant. It’s a powered fast food place. Maybe TGI Fridays will let me make a reservation.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1317 Centennial Ave

Put on hold with crazy music, only to be transferred to another person, who did not know if they deliver.  Is this a totally new question?  I'm the first?  EVER?  If they cannot answer that simple question, how can you trust anyone there to figure out temps for proper food preparations?  Hand washing?",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1317 Centennial Ave

Salad had too many croutons and dressing was on bottom. Salad was good. slow on refill. Had to ask for mints at the end. Tradition is mints. lastly they use a machine on table to pay. when it shows the amount and asks for tip it shows amount including tax.

So I asked for two rags to clean it up at the hostess station she gave them no problem. The food was great. Everyone enjoyed them. Also the waiter checked on us many times. The only thing I was dissatisfied about the 1st hostess I asked rolled her eyes and how much was spilled that she will be over with the rags even though i said I just wanted to take care of it. The other hostess could see it so said she said I'll get them for you and did. Overall very great place.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1317 Centennial Ave

Have been there a dozen times being my kids favorite place for dining. Only thing noticed is on busy days, which is almost all the time we went either they would want to serve the bread sticks very late or they don't get it at all till you complete dinner. I guess mostly its due to availability during busy times, but one time I can understand but this seems to be case almost all the time.

I have been to this location several times.  I have always had to send my soup and entree back at least once because they arrived cold. Another issue is that they haven't once offered a salad refill and servers have just grabbed the salad bowl off my table in the middle of my meal without offering me more. I have noticed the same with the breadsticks. On one visit I came in with a group of people and the only person offered or served salad was the one person who ordered soup and salad.  At any other Olive Garden these things are always. offered to all diners with their meals.  During some visits service was slow.

Visits to Olive Garden were during the covid-19 pandemic.  It is not based upon in-dining, but instead on food choices, quality, curbside service, adhering to safety guidelines during the pandemic.  My various food orders were  made via online, allowing for eClub discounts, and pre-payments.  Email confirmation and directions for curbside pickup were without problems.  My orders were always accurately prepared, and ready for pickup on time.  Each server was courteous and seemed friendly.  All food orders were  nice and hot enough, even for  a thirty minute drive home.

17202,123,51,Italian,2,05/19/2020,"The food was good. The 2 stars are for the server who kept disappearing for long periods of time. I'm talking we were sitting there with all the dirty plates from the soups and salads for over 25 minutes until we flagged down another waitress who was flabbergasted herself on why no one had water and immediately started cleaning up the table and brought over water for the table. She then went to find our waiter for us, 10 more minutes pass until our waiter comes out with 4 of the 5 main course plates he didn't say a word about where the last order was. So you figure a party of 5 would get a manager or someone over to ask how everything is but nope not one person aside from the waitress who came over to help us. So finally after everyone else is more than half done with their main course does my food come out no I'm sorry for the wait not even any acknowledgement that I was awkwardly sitting watching everyone else eating.

I am extremely upset and I refuse to make this drive and waste my gas. I can't believe how completely dry this fettuccine alfredo was. The salad had poor quality lettuce. I hope this situation gets better in the future. I spent more than $40 for horrendous quality food.

Disappointed with service and attitude of the server.

17234,156,51,Italian,2,05/20/2018,"Don't expect authentic taste or real Italian food here at this chain restaurant. If its for a corporate or large group where taste doesn't matter, this works just fine. But I wouldn't recommend this for dates or family dinners.    The soup is really average, the salad is decent and bread sticks are decent with seasoning. Without seasoning is like throwing up in your own mouth lol We first got the Marinara dipping sauce for bread sticks which was below average. We then got Angry Alfredo which was much more flavorful for a dipping.    The food is below average with no flavor or taste. The portion sizes took a toll in the recent past so expect smaller portion sizes as well. Personally, I wouldn't recommend this place for lunch or dinner, but if someone already decided this location, I's go back again, not otherwise.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1317 Centennial Ave

We were already almost finishing our dinner, so I asked our server about the breadsticks. She looked at me like I'm stupid, and said that breadsticks are a commodity so they come when they come out of the oven. However, when I looked around, every single table around us had breadsticks, even though they were set one hour after us. We finally got our breadsticks when most of us were already done with dinner, and, of course, nobody needed them at that point. No apologies were offered by the server, she behave distant like all the rest of the times when she spoke to us.

19145,2,57,Italian,4,05/19/2022,"I used to go to Olive Garden probably once a month 2001-2010 with the family. It was a lovely place to go. It declined after that, we went less often, the menu changed, and then we just stopped. Fast Fwd to the 202X and feelings of nostalgia creep back in... Remember the salad and the bruschetta, the stuffed mushrooms? Now the menu is mostly fried or baked stuff, just heavy. The drinks are better, fruitier it seems, the salad is still great (why so few tomatoes) and the soups were tempting... Entrees were fine... I want to re-discover this chain. I hope they recapture the magic. This location was well kept, and clean. Staff seemed to wander, only 2 x people were actually working, but 4 others were wandering. That's the new normal I guess.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,505 Gateway Dr

19147,4,57,Italian,5,10/21/2022,Great service by our server Werley!  He really paid attention to us and was quick on the refill of drinks and very pleasant to speak with.  The Service Manager Holly came over to see if we were okay and enjoying ourselves which was nice.  The food as always in all my experiences was fresh and tasty!  I always love the Tour of Italy and my husband had the never ending pasta bowl which was great for him with so many combinations!  The iced tea flavored and flavored lemonades did not dissapoint either.  They were fruity and delicious! Also this is the only restaurant I will eat the calamari and the salad and breadsticks are a great start to the meal.  I love the strawberry cream cake and the presentation they do for a birthday!  Delicious and satisfying!,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,505 Gateway Dr

19150,7,57,Italian,1,10/21/2022,"I will preface with the fact that the ONLY reason I agreed to come to this culinary Black Hole was because it was the birthday girl's request. I admit that I was hoping it wouldn't be as bad as I remembered. I was wrong. So very wrong.    Service: Terrible. Our server was a young guy, but he was sooo bad. It took about 45 minutes for water. Drinks were about the same. We had to repeat requests for EVERYTHING. Salad. Breadsticks. Cheese. Water. And considering how salty the food was, we REALLY needed that water.    Food: Immediate high blood pressure inducingly salty. From the salad, to the breadstucks to the entrees themselves. EVERYTHING had too much salt. Now I generally don't prepare my own meals with salt but I DO eat out. The salt levels in the food are ridiculous.  Aside from the salt content, when our entrees DID arrive it was obvious that they had been sitting out for a while waiting to be delivered to our table. Congealed and gross looking. Lukewarm. Also, if there were 6 pieces of 1 mushroom in the Chicken Marsala that was a lot. Again, underwhelming taste.    Drinks: One of our party ordered a lemonade that came to the table promptly. That was it. As I stated earlier, we had to wait 45 minutes for 2 frozen Italian Margaritas. Maybe the drinks were sitting out along with the meal, because when they were finally brought to the table they weren't frozen, they were Melted Margaritas with ice chips.    Epic fail. It's literally been 5+ years since I have visited an Olive Garden. Now I remember why. Don't waste your time.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,505 Gateway Dr

My family and I were rudely served by a waitress names Tati !!  who not only never said you’re welcome nor thank you but rudely rushed my family and I through out the service. Along with not only slamming a plate down on the table but complained about where to put things down before we could tell her where to put it. An additional waiting 20 mins for water to come to the table along with the utensils, unfortunately I was expecting nothing but the best service, but sadly received the worst service of all.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,505 Gateway Dr
19160,18,57,Italian,4,04/19/2023,It was okay.  Limit interaction and suggestion from wait staff made it seem like a fast food instead of a restaurant.  The chef tried but made my salmon SALTY... Whoa!  I honestly felt it was a mistake.  Other staff were so pleasant.  Very clean dining but need to pay attention to bathroom.  Great for lunch meeting at an affordable price.  House salad..

The free salad was delicious. The food portions were perfect and yummy. The pasta is always more than one person could eat in one sitting, so I got half of my dinner to go.

19171,29,57,Italian,2,05/19/2020,"Olive Garden, and this location in particular is super hit or miss. My last experience was good and I had an optimistic outlook on this location but I visited recently (Dec 2019) and it's not looking so good again. They were having this promotion of getting an entree for $5 with the purchase of a dine-in entree. So my mother and I decided to go for it, however, upon returning home and taking a look at the frozen packed food they'd given us, there was no date of when the food was made. Just that it should be eaten within 2 days. How can you be sure if it was made the day you received it?    Out of caution we tossed what are essentially-frozen dinners. Their food from our dine-in experience mediocre. My pasta was flavorful but my moms salmon did not taste fresh. Tasted quite old.    Their dolcini for dessert is extremely tiny, hence the $2 price tag. Don't bother ordering it. Coffee/cappuccino is really horrible also. Making your own at home will cost far less and taste twice as more expensive.    Our server was nice but that's about it. The carpet remains musty and the booths have gotten even dirtier than the last time.    I usually like Olive Garden but this location is sinking further down the hole than I've seen it in the past. Pass up, McDonalds is a way better option than this.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,505 Gateway Dr

(3) When we were finally seated next to the bar area the booth was dirty, floor was wet and we were moved to the back didn't make a difference still was a mess. (4) OMG the waitress was so slow and waiting for the food was like waiting for an eternity, we received exactly 4 garlic bread even after requested more it never showed up, The soup omg we can forget about it, ordered raspberry lemonade received iced tea by the time the food came it was barely warm and was very disappointing even after waiting for this long.

19183,41,57,Italian,2,08/22/2022,"There was an expected waitlist, we were told 1.5 hours, so we left and went to the groceries to pass the time. After 1 hour we were called and hurried back. The lovely Destiny at the door was very welcoming. For her pleasant attitude alone, I'd return.... But otherwise I wouldn't. Anyway, everything took  forever! We'd eaten through our appetizers, soup and calamari and the house salad and waited at least 12 mins for the food.  By the time the main course arrived I didn't want to eat again. We took the food home and it went in the bin. We'd been eating in Woodbridge New Jersey the standard is very high there. Also ordered another drink and it came after the meal was done. The waitress was awesome though. Sorry, won't return.    UPDATE    So I returned because my friend was hungry and had never been to Olive Garden and wanted to try it. Remembering my last experience here, I hesitated but went. We were seated at a not so clean table, I try to use napkins to clean it. It was 12pm. There was a dead bug on the window sill. Nice huh! Server took the order. We, like the last time, ate through the calamari, salad and soup and waited forever for the food. Remember I said we were seated at 12. It was now 12:45. We both had zoom meetings to attend and I got up trying to find someone to cancel the food so we could leave. The lady I spoke with told me to let the server know but I'd hit the call button for a while and no one came. Finally she came with the food and said they burnt the salmon so they had to do another one and offered to box the meal for take away. Disappointing. A little courtesy goes a long way in human relationships. We had the food removed from the tab and left. Now I know I'm NEVER RETURNING. What a rotten way to give someone their first experience at OG.  I don't know why it's so poor in Brooklyn but do better because your standard outside of Brooklyn, and New York in general, is supreme.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,505 Gateway Dr

I took about 15 minutes to get our soup and salads and 45 for our entre, this could be because the place was really busy, but it seemed like they were well staffed. The food is ok, its not great.

Our waitress finally came and told us she would see us within a few minutes after she'd been tending two tables in our section. At this point we spoke to a manager and explained our issues and we decided not to have dinner and left. We then went to a neighboring restaurant within the same shopping center (Applebee's) and within 5-10 minutes of being seated, our waiter came to our table and tended to us.

But for me and my family I think that might have been the last time I would ever step foot in another olive garden due to service. From now on I'm just gonna go to local real Italian restaurants or even local pizzerias as now I see you as the McDonald's of Italian food.

I get it, things happen but I was looking for my waiter for a while and after the food came he slightly checked in on us and disappeared until it was time to pay. I had to ask other waiters for everything my table needed. i think they need to improve customer services overall. Stay professional cause the food is great. Parking is okay and there's access for wheelchairs, there are also high chairs and a mini computer to keep children busy.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,505 Gateway Dr
19294,156,57,Italian,1,05/19/2022,Olive Garden is my favorite restaurant! I have been going to the Gateway Olive Garden since it opened. I even make it point to get a tour Italy in when I visit NY. Yesterday was the worse experience ever. We were sat down and didn't receive service for almost 20 mins. We had to flag down a waitress just to get our server over to us. She took our orders and disappeared. Showed up 10 mins later with bread sticks and soup but disappeared for almost 25 minutes. No drinks no appetizers. No nothing. Had to talk to the manager to get everything situated. He explained that he has new staff and we were not supposed to be seated at that specific table and she was upset. She kept taking care of the other tables and didn't care for us. All good.    Finally got our food but something was different about my tour Italy. There was an abundance of salt all over. Like it was purposely done. I woke up this morning feeling like I swallowed a bottle of salt. This is crazy. I truly hope that karma hits all those that sabotaged our meals just because we were tired of waiting. Never again,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,505 Gateway Dr

My father whom is 79 years old today will not soon forget his incredible birthday experience here at Olive Garden. She just naturally fit in with my family. She even suggested me Chicken Margehrita, which I had and it was incredible. Thank You Alexus! You were second to none in making it that much more pleasant.

Very busy; wait time are incredibly long also.  / thank you for responding but I’ll add my respond here and say some staff need better training in service and in making the food. Customers do not care how busy you are; but we care about the quality and service received. When I was there it was like I was asking permission to eat. A lot of rudeness. I been there several times in past. I will not be returning; especially when some in my group did not do so well after eating the some of the chicken meals.

When I came in first to the reception as I told her I had reservations made for 8 PM, she stated that whether I made reservations  or not I still had to wait 30 minutes until their seats available  to put together. She basically said that there’s no such thing as reservations and I had to wait. When we finally got seated the waiter that took care of the table had a bad attitude and seemed annoyed that she was there. Anytime we requested a drink or ask for the menu she seemed frustrated. She stated she had a lot of tables to serve but honestly it was a Monday at 8 PM and The restaurant wasn’t even full.  It took forever to get the bread and salad along with the drinks, and when the drinks came she had got it messed up and acused us for giving her the wrong information.

19335,199,57,Italian,3,05/20/2019,"The quality of the food has really gone down. Maybe they think they don't have to try as hard since they are the only location in Brooklyn.    The last time we went there (a few months ago) we ate in their dining room and the food was okay, nothing to write home about. My problem then was that they had a new appetizer we wanted to try. The apparently ran out (we were not the only ones apparently) and our server never came back to let us know that they didn't have any. Then, when we got our check it was still on there. Couple that with a so-so meal and you have one annoyed couple on date night.    Fast forward to this time, we decided to get a meal to go. The app was acting up so we had to go inside to order so we are already annoyed. It took 10 minutes before someone came to the to-go counter to take out order. The food came in a timely enough fashion but it was overcooked and  dry with very little sauce (though it probably would not have helped).

Never asked if we wanted soup or salad prior to placing our entree order. When we finally placed our entree order she still didn’t offer us either option and we had to bring it up ourself. Didn’t offer to put cheese on anything or ask how anything tasted. Never offered to refill our drinks without us asking. Lack of enthusiasm, made us feel unwelcome.

We waited, when they took us to our table it was not a booth. When the server came back to take our order we asked if we could move to the booth right next to us which was empty, she kindly said yes. Another VERY RUDE serve approached us and asked us to please get up from the booth she said you guys can’t sit here if you want to sit here you have to go back to the front and wait for a booth I calmly told her that the other server had told us it was ok to change seats. She rudely responded  there’s a 30 min wait for this booth we moved back to our original table and the first server came back to us and told us no go back to the booth it’s ok you guys can sit there. So again we moved to the booth. Right when we were FINALLY about to eat our salads the rude server comes back and asked you to get up from the booth again that we had to wait for a booth in the front. I told her we were just going to leave. Never in my life have I experienced such terrible customer service. She didn’t even try to accommodate us and just let us leave. We had already waited for so long just to be seated just to go through all this. My boyfriend and I were starving from shopping all day and just wanted to enjoy a nice dinner.

Given another pager and waited 30 minutes more. Food was so-so nothing to brag about. Never have I experienced missing out on a happy birthday. The staff didn't wait when told that people in the party were missing and did it anyways. Some family members  including myself  missed out on the celebration for my husband and sister because my other sister and I were changing our sons diapers.

19359,223,57,Italian,4,05/20/2019,"This location is very nice. It’s usually busy all the time being located inside a shopping complex. Food is always great and they have very friendly staff who take the time to explain the menu and featured offers. Only thing I will complain is not having enough staffing when it’s busy. My server was great but because of all the tables he was serving, it was hard to reach him if I needed something. Other then that, great restaurant, always clean and always have good tasting food. There’s also long wait time because of it being so busy. I suggest you join the wait-line on olive garden website in that way your not waiting 1+ hour for a table.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,505 Gateway Dr

19361,225,57,Italian,5,05/19/2020,I love going there. Sometimes it’s a long wait but the service makes it all worthwhile.  There’s a worker there and she goes out of her way. Love her to pieces! I’ve been lucky enough to get her every time I go there. She even gave me the complimentary wine of the day.  Great hospitality and great portions for your buck!

19362,226,57,Italian,1,05/20/2019,"There are so many things wrong with this location. 1. Ladies bathroom door is too close to the sink, so you can cause an accident by hitting someone if you are rushing. 2. The wait time to be seated on a MONDAY IS RIDICULOUS!! 3. The time it takes to receive your order is UNACCEPTABLE. We were seated in a booth in the bar area. There was one waitress for 5 tables...she could barely keep up. 4. The food is SUPER SALTY!! 5. The table kiosk was faulty and did not print my receipt. I then had to wait to checkout! I won't be going there again...",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,505 Gateway Dr

19368,232,57,Italian,4,05/20/2019,"The waitress Lisa was really bubbly and amicable, one of the high points of the experience. The wait was long, however, partially due to indecisiveness and partly due to the other tables that needed attending to. The food itself was nice and hot and tasted fine, could have used more flavor for a better pop. There was too little sauce in the plate, though, a bit more would have changed the feel of the food. Not perfect but worth going to at least once for the experience.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,505 Gateway Dr

19370,234,57,Italian,1,05/20/2018,"I've been to many different Olive Garden restaurants before, and this one is by far the worse experience I have ever had. First, as we walked in the host was nowhere to be found and we waited 15 minutes before we were seated, while the place was almost empty. Then, we had to wait another 20 minutes for our waitress to approach us. By the mean time we placed an appetizer order through the tablet that was on the table. We got the artichoke and cheese deep. As we were eating we found plastic wrapper pieces in it and called the manager. The manager came, apologized and took it off our bill explaining that the chef messed up somehow. Soon after, we got our salad and when we asked the waitress to grind some cheese on top. She made a face, went in the kitchen to get the cheese and sprinkled some cheese that was not even noticeable and left. 10 minutes later we got our main dishes that we ordered, and i must say they were delicious so we decided to also go for desserts which also were very good. The WORST part of this was, after we finished eating and paid for our meals on this tablet, the waitress came rushing in, SNATCHED it from my hand right after i tipped (which i shouldn't have), and just proceeded to give everything a 5/5 on the survey part!  Disgusting!! I hope the corporation will see this because the Service, plastic pieces in our food, and the fake survey they take themselves, is absolutely disgusting. I WILL NEVER BE BACK TO THIS LOCATION.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,505 Gateway Dr

19373,238,57,Italian,1,05/19/2020,I love this restaurant let me start by saying that but my waitress Christina M. was terrible. She never came to our table and to add insult to injury she helped herself to a tip she didn't deserve. The kiosk on the table to pay your bill she purposely punched in a $22 tip. Of course I was upset and wanted to speak with her manager who was very nice and fixed our bill. Also the table next to us was also credited because they complained as well. Never have I ever heard of someone doing that so I strongly believe that she does this all the time. Christina M. should be fired. I should've called the cops on her. Be aware of this girl if you eat there.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,505 Gateway Dr

She waived to me to go in without offering any menu or anything else. At the table I've waited long time before my brother had called for the waiter. His highness wasn't friendly and because I didn't know he was mad at me as a guess I ordered. He served me the food without knife nor folk, and when i called him to get me some, he impolitly said that i didn't wait for him at the reception. We had business in New York, and we didn't had the need for any aggravation, I just smiled and got up to my car and got knife and folk I always keep with me. He saw me doing just that but because he didn't have dignity nor good manners, he wasn't moved to apologize or show some remorse. If I've waisted my time with him or aggravated my self, my brother and I will never succeed making a deal with a local fortune 500 corporation.

I was told how the wait time is always long, I waited about 25 minutes to get my table. I noticed staff looks stress and most are not happy about working here. Can't blame them when you feel overworked for low income that comes with it. Plus the customer they service are also at time rude. So one thing leads to another, next thing you know, everyone is up-set and that the beginning to the end of everything. Try a different Olive Garden and see the difference in service.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,505 Gateway Dr

The bread sticks were hot out of the oven fresh. But the service left much to be desired. The Male host took us to a dirty table and when I asked him to remove the child seat from the previous customers thinking he would see the greasy finger prints all over the table and chairs he just looked at me and walked away. After several employees had to of see me wiping chairs and table not one came to assist or correct the problem. I won't be returning.

19389,254,57,Italian,1,05/20/2019,Where do I start? Okay so for Valentine's Day we decided to go here. Worst decision EVER we sat at the bar ordered food then our buzzer went off upon which time we were seated at a booth. Took us half an hour to get them to figure out how to get our food to the table  Next we got crumby food sent it back. The next plates were decent. We finished eating went outside to wait for our Uber then the real show began. An employee or should I say chicken head pulls up with her crew and begins yelling and screaming at another employee and they cause a huge commotion. The whole staff comes out to watch along with the other patrons. Felt like we were in the audience of Jerry Springer. I will never go to another Olive Garden again. First and last time I step foot in here. Didn't wanna go in the first place now they ruined it.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,505 Gateway Dr
19390,255,57,Italian,1,05/20/2018,The only good thing about this place was our server. She was very nice.

19392,257,57,Italian,2,05/19/2020,"I was looking forward to my meal, because whenever I have eaten for any olive garden the food was amazing. However this experience was the complete opposite, we ordered takeout and the food was bland, no seasoning nothing. Not even the salad was good, they forgot to give us the parmasen cheese and there was something missing from the dressing. The only thing that tasted like what I am use to was the bread sticks. I'm very disappointed. Will not order from here again.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,505 Gateway Dr
19393,258,57,Italian,4,05/20/2019,"I've always been a fan of Olive Garden but I be Live the waiters are being over worked and the chiefs are forced to prepare a high volume of good under pressure. One person had her food placed on the table before the rest of us received anything. Once we were served we still had one person missing their plate, which came out several minutes after. So it was a total of 12 minutes we waited for everyone to receive their food.    Overall it was okay but my hopes is that they can work on serving all dishes at 2 minute intervals. That way they will not have to keep the plates under a heating lamp too long, drying the food out.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,505 Gateway Dr
19394,259,57,Italian,3,05/19/2021,"Overall I would say it's ok. Pasta was stuck together and was a bit hard. The chicken cutlet was cooked well.

Just as I get comfortable and am ready to dig in, I notice that there's no cutlery in the bag. My husband walked back to the restaurant to get some. There were olives in my salad despite my request to omit them. My fettuccine alfredo with grilled shrimp was lukewarm which annoyed me because our food should've been hot. I didn't have the energy to complain about it so I started eating my pasta. After my second forkful I notice a hair in my food. Now I'm totally disgusted. With everything happening with Covid-19 you'd think that hair nets would be mandatory. We walked back to the restaurant and requested a refund.

My daughter finished her Apple juice and before I could request another she was at out table with another one and another drink for me too!

Although a table next to us seem to get their food with no problem and they came in after us.    When the food came it had a raw smell for the seafood and it was bland and tasteless. The tried to make it up by giving up free dessert but the dessert was not the best. Tirumasu was icy. And the also took some money off the bill.    The waiter was good and we felt sorry for him and gave him a tip anyway. It was my Moms Birthday and it was ruined, worst experience ever.

I would honestly give this establishment a higher rating however we were displeased with how a few waitresses were bullying a specific staff member that was having trouble with her duties and responsibilities. These matters need to be handled privately and away from the eye of the public. Specially away from those that have chosen this establishment to celebrate something as special as a birthday. The food was great, the birthday cake and singing were amazing. I do not question the integrity of the cook or the waitress who took care of our table.

19430,295,57,Italian,2,05/20/2019,"We have been to this Olive Garden over 20 times since it opened in the Gateway Mall. We usually go for lunch when we visit BJ'S or Target. It's food has been consistent in quality and taste and the service has almost always been good. After our latest visit it may be our last visit. We were seated in the front by the bar. Our waitress was friendly, offered my husband information on some items not on the menu and took our order. My drink was so full of sugar I choked on it. She replaced it with one that had less but was still undrinkable, which has never happened before. My food order was fine. My husband ordered the Vegetable & Cheese Piadina but when he began to take a bite he discovered it was the chicken Piadina. Our waitress had already disappeared. We waited a few minutes for her to return and then he asked the bartender to page her. He then asked a passing waiter to get her. During that time the hostess seated 3 more tables and he twice asked her to get our waitress. After 20 minutes he went to the take out counter and asked to see the manager. That's when our waitress returned and unapologetically told us she had been in a meeting with the manager.  What kind of management schedules a meeting with the waitstaff while they are serving customers? If it was urgent why didn't the waitress get someone to cover her tables? Why didn't the Manager arrange coverage? When we questioned the waitress she shrugged in answer. We told her to remove the item from our bill since the incorrect sandwich was uneaten and we weren't waiting for a replacement. Before we left we again asked to speak to the manager. After waiting 10 minutes to no avail we left. I sent an email to Olive Garden but that also was a waste of my time. As an aside, 2 of the 3 tables seated during our 20 minute wait got up and left the restaurant.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,505 Gateway Dr

The food was great I had the chicken marsala. It was very good despite missing some mushrooms. My sister had the chicken scampi. She didn't complain about it so that is a good thing. Our friend  had the salmon with broccoli. It looked really good. Keep up the great work !  I like the sitting area as well becuase everyone  has there privacy which is very important.

She recognized the difference between what I ordered and what I received. She offered to have it changed but by this time it was too late. I had to be somewhere else.

Staff still seems overwhelmed or overworked and the front end needs some customer service training. Smiles n greetings are a staple at most well-run establishments. Following up and checking on diners typically leads to increased sales.  I could've choked to death by the time anyone asked if I needed or wanted a second drink.

19480,346,57,Italian,1,05/20/2018,"First let me say I am a long time customer of Olive Garden especially this location. On average I used 2 come in 2x or more a week so I know the menu and how things work. I always sit at the bar because there is faster service. Plus I can watch the employees interact with each other and how they handle the food/drinks especially my own.    Management must of changed because customer service has become HORRIBLE. I visited on Wed evening and sat in my usual spot. The bartender had no idea how to make drinks, even when I ordered straights off the menu. She never cleared away the obviously dirty plates from the earlier patrons that wss next to me off the table even after i tried to subtly hint at it by pushing them closer to the edge so they could fall off. The dirty plates was present during my entire meal. Can you believe two ladies were behind the bar the whole time. And dont get me started on the number of fruit flies swarming around. I ate half my meal thinking if the front of the house is this dirty I would be scared to see whats going on in the kitchen.    Came back again on Fri during lunch time and found similar conditions. Dirty bar area and a bartender that doesn't know how to mix drinks. Too many fruit flies still swarming around. I wonder when was the last time the Health Dept came by?

19481,347,57,Italian,1,05/20/2016,I didn't even want to give them the one star but I gave it to them because they had chairs. the service sucked I had a waitress that look like she just got out of bed the food was awful not like olive gardens I've been to in the past . I only got 2 refills of lemonade before they told me it was finished she only bought two refills of salad and on top of that they took at least 45 minutes to bring the food that was awful oh my god on top of that I asked to speak with a manager and she took 30 minutes to come. From hostess to manager extremely ghetto with poor Service.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,505 Gateway Dr
19482,348,57,Italian,1,05/19/2020,"Waiting for nearly 45 minutes for the waitress to come by to take our order for food. Very nasty attitudes and I would like corporate people to come see what they are doing in the restaurant, who they hired and if I was a food critic at this restaurant right now ,I will personally give this restaurant an F grade for lack of service, don't know how to greet us when people come to come to the door and they hired black only with no experience. THEY ARE RACIST. IF YOU ARE NOT THEIR OWN KIND WHO DOESN'T GET SERVED HERE, I WOULD NOT STEP FOOT INTO THIS RESTAURANT NOR THE OTHER RESTAURANT AT CAESAR'S BAY.

19485,351,57,Italian,3,05/19/2020,The food isn't as good as it use to be.  I had the seafood alfredo pasta without the shrimp and eventhough it was well cooked the alfredo sauce was lacking. The bread sticks were warm and the salad was good. My friend had the sampler and she stated her disappointment in her meal as well. The alcohol beverages and the pumpkin cake was delicious and highly recommended.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,505 Gateway Dr
19486,352,57,Italian,1,05/20/2019,"I understand that this location has only been open for a few weeks, but it seemed like everything was out of order for the most part. I don't like to complain unless it's absolutely warranted, but other guests were voicing their dissatisfaction openly.  The soup and bread sticks were on par with other olive gardens, but the giant chicken parmesan that I ordered was absolutely unacceptable for the near $20 price . It was essentially one large flat piece of processed chicken, much like a chicken nugget, that had more breading than chicken and absolutely too much salt. After taking 2 bites I had already lost my appetite . Thankfully the soup had unlimited refills or I would have walked away hungry.  I took the chicken home and heated it up the next day thinking the salt flavor might have dulled out a bit, but unfortunately that wasn't the case . Rarely do I throw food away, but I'd hardly classify this dish as something edible.  Please take this ""chicken"" off the menu so no one else has the displeasure of tasting this monstrosity of a dish.  When it comes to the drink that I ordered (Pina colada), it came out warm and oddly thick, like they just poured a Pina colada mix into my cup without blending ice or anything else for that matter, and the liquor was basically non existent.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,505 Gateway Dr

We had to ask for everything from water to utensils to reminding the waitress several times what our appetizer and meal were. When the appetizer came, the fried mozz and ravioli were dripping with oil and the calamari looked like the last smallest bits one finds in a bag of frozen food.    The pasta was drowned in sauce and the chicken was black on the bottom. Placed strategically and covered in sauce. SMH.

19490,356,57,Italian,3,05/20/2019,I mean as far as Italian cuisine goes they are really pedestrian. The pasta had no taste. Serving time is eh. And my date turned back 3 of her meals before we finally decided to get out of there. Parking is disastrous as they share a parking lot with red lobster.

The meatballs were good but with the pastas they dont give enough sause which can make it a bit dry. The food wasnt as great as I thought it would be going to an olive garden for the first time.

We don't eat pork for religious and health reasons and if you don't ask their policy is if the customer don't ask don't tell which is very unprofessional!  Its a good thing my wife asked what is the lasagna made with?    This will be the last time my wife and I and anybody else in our family eats at the Olive Garden restaurant chain.

And you can't say anything about that because she WILL remind you that she breastfed you if you do, but honestly that's the best part of the salad, and I consider this to be an unjust society where olives are subject to an authoritarian regime. Also the fried lasagna bites are pretty good, and I also recommend the zoodles. The iced coffee had plenty of sugar and very little coffee but it tasted okay enough. More like a shake. Veggies good. Firm, not overcooked and squishy. I hate that. Smack the next person who mutilates a perfectly good vegetable. Pesto could be better.

First of all, bottomless breadsticks and salads you can live off on alone but if you dare to venture further (and you will) then their menu has all of the American known italian dishes plus a couple of interesting ones such as fried ravioli. We had gotten the bottomless pasta and could barely get through the second plate; gluttons. Wine was on point flavor wise, a delightful accompaniment to the meal and reasonably priced.

Meat ball sandwich at lunch with fries is great deal. I always get at least 2 bowls of soup instead of salad. Chicken cutlet or chicken piccata with pasta is excellent. Never had an issue with attitude of servers. Normal menu prices are on high side but you are getting soup or salad.

I'm sorry I didn't take a picture. I just asked for my bill, kept my cool and left.  That's how people get sick, you dont know who was playing in that ketchup.

The server was very responsive and visited the table few times to see if we needed anything. The food, however, I felt has been drifting towards mundane compared to what it used to be years ago. I've been going to Olive garden's for over a decade, probably once a year on average and never had any complaints about the food. But this time it seemed like they changed up their sauce recipe, their bread recipes/baking process, and just the overall food experience wasn't quite up to par to expectations from past visits.. will continue to go there prob once a year.. so food wasn't horrible at least",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,777 NJ-18

It's entertaining to go and kids always have something to do because of the entertainment provided, and there's nice seating arrangements located in the restaurant. The only issue we had was the table we got was really small, and our server, Roeanne was really calm and dealt with all of our issues, however due to circumstances in the resteraunt we couldn't be moved to a bigger table and we all had to cramp our food.

Food: Ordered eggplant parmigiana, five cheese baked marinara pasta, fettuccine alfredo and three kids menu. It was strictly ok and the side bread was hard and tad bit stale and the overall salt and spice level need adjustment.    Ambience: Quite nice and bustling with people. The only challenge was temperature control, there were few cold spots and hot areas making it super weird feeling!

All the entrees come with breadsticks and a huge delicious salad.  For the price it can’t be beat.  At this location I had the lasagna and 5 cheese ziti Al Forno.  The lasagna was delicious!  I loved the meat sauce!  The 5 cheese ziti Al Forno was good, but not great.  It could of been more cheesier, and it needed more sauce for the outer edges of the dish.  For dessert I had their seasonal pumpkin cheesecake special, and that was very good!  It tasted more like a rich pumpkin pie than a cheesecake though.  This location has great servers working here.  I’m looking forward to many more dinners here, and I’ll update my review after I try a few more dishes.  I recommend Olive Garden in East Brunswick!",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,777 NJ-18

21334,8,64,Italian,3,09/21/2022,The only criticism I have is for a restaurant of your name you could serve better shrimp. Our local pizzeria serves bigger shrimp on their Shrimp Scampi. Your popcorn size shrimp isn't worth the price on Shrimp Scampi or Shrimp Alfredo dishes. The picture is the left over shrimp where I had for lunch over broccoli. The other picture is my local pizzerias Shrimp Scampi. I think you can do better.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,777 NJ-18

I felt the front desk employee who welcome guest must be more welcoming. I felt they were just no friendly and did not smile. They did greet us but it was pale.

She even packed up my dinner for me all while joking with us.  I had to rush out and get my son so I left dad to grab the food. When I got home the bag was stuffed in the fridge and I thought nothing of it. Today I grabbed the bag with the intention of having it for lunch and my food wasn't in there. Of course dad only thought about his belly and soup. I called the restaurant in hopes that they would be able to replace the meal and Steve, the manager in the AM, said no problem, and to bring the receipt for proof of purchase and ask to speak to a manager.  After work, I went there and Eric greeted me, shook my hand and was very friendly. I explained my situation and he said no problem. He replaced my entire meal! Gave me more soup, and bread...and I loooove the soup (gnocchi). I never had a bad experience here and I come here at least 7 times a year.

The service was extremely slow and there was more than enough help as they all kept congregating around the hostess area. At times there were 6 milling around.

21347,24,64,Italian,3,04/19/2023,"So I've been going to olive garden for decades. There are a lot of good things about Olive garden for what it is. Not pretending it's some truly Italian restaurant... You know what it is. The thing that really bothered me about my last visit is that I decided to just get the create your own spaghetti. The person I was with ordered eggplant parmesan. The dishes were 9.99 each and came with salad & breadsticks. When the food arrived it was completely visible that the person I was with and I have the same amount of spaghetti which is literally the size that used to be their side (if you order it separately from a meal). Now yes I realize it was lunch, so the portions are smaller however a person ordering spaghetti as a meal should get a full meal of it. While I was at the restaurant I just decided not to complain because I was in a bit of a hurry. However the person I was with was upset over it as well because it was clearly obvious that I probably should have ordered what she ordered and then just give her the extra food to take home because this was a blatant rip-off $10 for an amount of spaghetti that can fit in a soda can. About an hour later she called the restaurant and complained to the manager who we saw when we were there prior to being seated. He identified that he remembered talking to us, and said that he was sorry we were disappointed with the portions however he was not willing to do literally anything to accommodate our disappointment... So if you go, don't purchase pasta only .... Might as well get some actual food for the same price ",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,777 NJ-18

Since they did not go with an adult, they were not exactly sure how to tip the waitress, Kristen H., so they gave her 12%. When they were in the bathroom, the waitress went inside and cursed them because they did not give the full 15%.

We were seated and a server came to our table in a reasonable amount of time. We got our drinks quickly and received our breadsticks. No complaints about the service at all, compared to my last experience eating out it was great. The food was good and portion were decent. My only complaint was that the tables seemed kind of close and it was busy. It was a little disconcerting when a elderly couple who were seated at the table next to us during our meal were staring at us, mainly the women. We weren't talking loud really. Except for the diminished atmosphere, everything was good.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,777 NJ-18

In the beginning I found one in the soap (unlimited serving)! I gave it back told them I don’t want more but she said she’ll make new plate as a take away.

21380,57,64,Italian,2,05/20/2019,"I love Olive Garden, and the service @ East Brunswick is very good, but they need to be more conscientious about what they are packaging and sending home in their To-Go orders.  We purchased food to be ready at a certain time, but it was obviously prepared way too far in advance as all of the food was ice cold. Additionally, the alfredo we ordered had next to ZERO alfredo sauce on it. Very disappointed.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,777 NJ-18

21382,59,64,Italian,2,05/20/2018,As soon as you walk into this establishment there is a weird smell throughout the eating areas. It is not just a smell of stuffy air but it feels like the floors and the wooden surfaces around the eating area have not been cleaned in a long time and are grimy.    Is a complete turn-off for any appetite you had left walking in. The staff however are very friendly and helpful. They will go out of their way to accommodate. However that does not change the fact that the food you will find yours extremely industrial and pedestrian. Are only reason for visiting this location is because our toddler kids absolutely demand the atmosphere and experience of going to Olive Garden.    Once my kids grow older and appreciate better Italian restaurants I swear I'll never come back to this chain.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,777 NJ-18

As we were leaving the same hostess told us thanks for coming and have a good night. I told her that were not even served anything and again that silly giggle. 2 hostesses standing doing nothing and no wait staff to even order drinks.

We were seated with menus in the back of the restaurant with plenty of empty tables nearby. No waiter came to take our order... Two other parties came in and were seated nearby. A waiter asked to take the order of those on the right side of room. I got up and went to group of waiters in the back. ""We need to be waited on..."" They said we'll find you a waiter. A different waiter came out and went to serve the 2nd table  on the left side of room. ""Excuse me. We were here first and haven't been waited on..."" Oh, you will have a different waiter. I got up and complained to a mor mature waiter. ""Oh, this is the busiest day of the year..."" I responded, ""Why ignore us and wait on 2 other parties that came after us?"" She was surprised. We were the only African Americans in the room--we couldn't be invisible.  I will no longer support ANY business that treats me like that. Shame on you Olive Garden wait staff.

21405,82,64,Italian,1,05/19/2022,"I went in expecting to be treated as normal and like an adult and as someone that is making a wage as well. Sadly I was disappointed, that when the waitress came up she gave my friends and I an attitude. All we wanted was to order our food and some of my friends wanted the soup and salad, there was some miscommunication. Before we could even try and figure out the whole thing with the salad and soup our waitress became very defensive and automatically asked if we wanted the manager. We were not looking to make anything difficult but we just went along with it at first so we weren’t difficult. The main problem being that when we tried to talk to our waitress she treated us like 8 year olds that were just dropped off by our parents or something. A server should never be assuming and treat ANY customer than as less than a customer. As someone that also works a job I understand dealing with rude customers, but from my perspective we were being pretty respectful. Once we talked to the manager she was much more understanding of the situation. But I want to make it aware the food wasn’t the problem it was the service.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,777 NJ-18

Disappointing to feel like it happened at this establishment. Our server gave us a lot of unnecessary attitude.

We were celebrating our Aunt's 98th birthday and the manager never checked on us, the waiter didn't receive any support at all. The food was subpar. The breadsticks were cold and hard. The Sangria was too sweet, they use cheap Moscato. Real Sangria doesn't have  Moscato!! We asked for a substitute and none was offered. Again no manager to address our needs.

The waiter was personable, but inept. Our orders were messed up.  The waitress working with him kept telling the children in the party to watch out or move. Basically I felt like we were all supposed to move the little ones around the table so she didn't need to be careful.

21473,152,64,Italian,1,05/20/2019,The experience at this location was very disappointing. Our server Kristen was not very professional and did not seem happy serving us. She did not offer us any soup or salad and came right away to take the order. My friends husband had to remind her to give us soup and salad. It seemed like she was in a mighty rush or had a bad day. I had ordered chicken soup but instead she served me minestrone soup saying the chicken soup would take longer. My friend who had asked for minestrone soup was told to pick up the soup that was given to me ...that was the limit. Why would my friend get up and take the soup from me . It's the servers job to serve the soup to the customer and have it placed in front of the person which is what my friend indicated. Last stroke was when the server put or rather say banged the bowl of salad on our table. This was the worst service we have seen as we have eaten at other locations of Olive Garden in Canada and US and never had been treated with such disrespect. It's a shame that these days people do not respect their jobs and work like they are doing a favor to the customers.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,777 NJ-18

While they were busy with making drinks for the servers for the restaurant, they would walk by my empty wine glass sitting right in front of them.

21476,155,64,Italian,2,05/19/2020,This place is an all right choice but the food isn’t great. It wasn’t anything special and the spaghetti was over cooked.

21477,156,64,Italian,3,05/19/2021,We decided to stop here for a nice bowl of Chicken Gnocci soup on a crisp day. Terrible choice we made. Soup had no taste because it seemed watered down.

We both tried different selections from the never ending stuffed pasta section. They were delightful. And of course, the OG salad is by far the best anywhere and the bread sticks are quite tasty.    Today, because of the snow, they were a bit short staffed so service was a little slower than normal. The few servers they had, however, worked well together to give customers the best service possible under the circumstances.    Prices are comparable with all their local competition.

Best of all my son Loves the place, he likes the feel, the music, the menu, the food the whole experience. While for the most part i have not been let down by one of their establishments, I am most fond of the one located at East Brunswick Sq mall.

After 15-20 minutes waiting and watching the wait staff have a conversation behind one of their terminals, I walked over to find out who our server was and that we never had anyone take our drink order yet.  Finally someone can over, and they said I'll take your drink order your server is caught up with something.  So she took our order and our waitress never came the same girl took our food order and someone else brought our apps out. The new waitress said that our old server got sent home???!!! Why???!!   She said she would be our server and apologized for everything. After that every thing went smoothly.  The date however, was sub par.  I ordered the tour of Italy, and the fettuccine Alfredo tasted like a milky cream sauce, no cheese or any ki d of taste. Very bland. The lasagna noodles where burnt on the bottom.  I am not sure if this a chain related thing to the sub par fare, or if it was just the restaurant we went too.

21498,177,64,Italian,3,05/19/2021,"Went to Olive Garden for my first time with my boyfriend during Sunday lunch. My two servers (changed because a shift ended) Siri and Abigail were WONDERFUL. Unfortunately my boyfriend and I were sat in the bar area which I understood because bar employees need tables too, nonetheless with the COVID situation. My issue with dining in was a result of inappropriate conversations held between servers and hosts as they passed by my table. One server even stopped directly in front of us and shouted Well I’m a little trashy so across the room to her colleagues. I understand needing to have side conversations to endure the work day- but I don’t need to hear about how trashy you say you are. No customer wants to hear that while they’re dining in. This same server went on to make a smoothie and wiped the rim of the to-go cup with her finger. Never should this be acceptable or dismissed but especially not during a global pandemic where every customer is waking into an establishment and trusting you with their health. As much as restaurants need customers to stay afloat, we need restaurants to stay sane, busy, and entertained. Please don’t expose anyone else to gross misconduct during a very serious global pandemic.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,777 NJ-18

Dessert was also good. Waiter was okay he could have came to the table few more time to see if we needed anything. I did not know you pay the bill at the table on the little computer.

21500,179,64,Italian,2,05/20/2018,"For starters, I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants.  That being said,   I think my days of going to an Olive Garden are limited. We went to the East Brunswick location today and the meal was decent at best. This one does get 1  additional star because unlike the New Brunswick location, our food did mot have hair in it. The service was quite slow even though we were there at the time the restaurant opened.    We ordered an appetizer trio of fried mozzarella, fried zucchini, and calamari.   The appetizer was served cold, so we had to send it back. The zucchini was inedible and was saturated in grease.    For my entree, I had the meatball sandwich lunch special which was good. My mother had the chicken gnocchi soup and there was only one gnocchi in the entire bowl.   My father had pasta faggiole which was decent.

Calamari is also worth to try.  As for pastas, spaghetti & meatballs (w/ meat sauce) and shrimp scampi are my picks; however, i find pastas here are typical and about average (but better than princeton branch).

It is noticeably obvious that these meals have been pre-packaged and heated for service but they still come out in a manner that is appetizing and pleasant tasting.  Certainly no mother and father family operated establishment.  But they did take the time to try to get that homemade feel for a fast food pre-prepared food location..  They could do better on the price knowing that the food is mass-produced off-site in a factory somewhere.

Honestly, I was full from the salad and forgot about the soup. The soup came out when my family was done with their entrees. As the waitress was placing the soup on the table, I said, Oh, wow! I forgot all about the soup. She replies, I don’t make the soup, I have no control over when it comes out.    Someone could use some etiquette and customer service training.

Due to covid limitation of people understandable. it is not cool that I have to wait 5-10 mins to place an order over the phone when online they do not have options for you to pay cash..,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,777 NJ-18
21524,203,64,Italian,1,05/19/2020,So I went there for dinner and accidentally left my purse when I returned 10 min later my purse was out in the open in the lobby and my cash was gone.. The employees had no idea it was mine but just let me grab it.. Then spoke to the manager on shift and was told sorry we don't have cameras to see what happen..not once did she apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.. In my opinion they were very unprofessional about the whole situation.. Why is there no proper protocol taken when someone leaves there personal items by a mistake.. There is no lostNfound? I will NEVER RETURN TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT.. Hopefully who ever stole my money out of my purse really needed it more then I did. It's a real shame I come here with my clients all the time and spend lots of money here and tip very well.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,777 NJ-18

We had placed the order online the day before and when we came, they said it wasnt sent to the kitchen and that it would be 15-20 mins. We waited an hour and asked for a status twice. It would’ve been better if they just told us the actual wait time, we would’ve cancelled the order. There were soo many people ( 6 to be exact) that was just standing around. It’s really inconsiderate and I’d probably wouldn’t do that again. I love olive garden but truthfully, probably wouldn’t visit this location again.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,777 NJ-18

The place was packed when I went there maybe because it was a weekend, but it was worth the wait.

21533,212,64,Italian,1,05/20/2017,"The worst Olive Garden I've ever been to. We were served grated parmesan cheese in a bowl which I don't even know where that bowl came from. It could have been sitting in the back for hours for all I know. Oh but check this another family next to us ordered their food and I waited to see if our waitress would freshly grated their cheese. Guess what, She sure did. I was livid. Her attitude sucked. Very unprofessional. I will never go here again. That's not the first time she served us either.

Im glad a manger got  involved to switch a pasta to a gluten free pasta.  I guess she didn’t appreciate the manager over ruling her, welcome to the world of pleasing a customer.  I can kind of accept her inability to serve us but she never gave us chocolate at the end. The menu clearly states they will substitute pasta but a I guess Luz our server didn’t read it....I did tip her but minimum hopefully she understands why, not tipping is wrong and 2 wrongs don’t make a right.

Service is always second to none, getting a table is always quick and easy (been here on Holidays, Fathers Day, Special occasions,  days when other restaurants have an unbearable wait, and the most I ever waited was 15 minutes), and food never disappoints.

Your pretty much eating pasta and pasta is cheap.  The salad is mostly lettuce and they give you  couple small tomatoes and 1 olive for a large salad.    For 2 people it came out two 60.00 for 1 large salad, 2 drinks , 3 pieces of cake and 2 meals.  .

21542,221,64,Italian,3,05/19/2020,"I have a strong nostalgia for this Olive Garden; we went out to dinner here shortly after it opened in the 90s, in light of my Dad having just been promoted.  We were not a wealthy family, so for us, at the time, a dinner at Olive Garden was fine dining.  Since then, I'm better aware of what the quality of food at Olive Garden actually is.  Entrees come precooked in a plastic bag; the bag is then boiled in water and the food is served once hot.  That being said, the classics menu (e.g. lasagna, chicken parm, ravioli, fettuccini Alfredo, etc), while not any kind of stellar Italian cuisine, is fine comfort food.  I've made the mistake in past visits of ordering special dishes (don't be fooled by the pictures in the menu, they make everything look so much better than it is): seafood is small, seems unnatural, and lacks flavor; I ordered chicken masala once that was dry and bland; and the biggest mistake I ever made was ordering a steak, which, although I ordered it medium rare, was among the toughest and gamiest steaks I've ever encountered.  The best menu items are unquestionably the salad and breadsticks; they taste good and they can be reordered inexorably at no charge (although this can also be viewed in a somewhat negative light, as this often results in people ordering a second round of salad and breadsticks only to have them go untouched and, ultimately, thrown away, which is a tremendous waste).  I can't say whether the soups are any good, because I've never tried any, vying always instead for the salad, although it is worth noting that they offer unlimited soup as well.   Prices are decent, but, when considering the poor quality of the food, they begin to appear rather steep.   It is worth noting, though, that Olive Garden offers frequent special offers, like endless pasta.  The atmosphere is nice: dim lights and all the Frank Sinatra and Dream Martin I want to hear in an Italian restaurant, plus there is an additional comfort derived from the fact that every Olive Garden is set up exactly the same, so every return visit, no matter the location, takes me back to my first Olive Garden experience. Taken for what it is, the Olive Garden is a decent place for families or, most especially, young high school and college aged people to eat, so long as you stick with the classics menu, soup, salad, and breadsticks, and don't expect to be dining on any authentic Italian cuisine.  Most desserts are good too, just stay away from the cannolis.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,777 NJ-18

21544,223,64,Italian,4,05/20/2019,Our server Annie/Anne was most attentive to our needs with kindness and thoughtfulness going above and beyond making us feel so welcome and helpful.  We were 4 adults and 3 young children and it was on a Tuesday night.  We enjoyed free refills of fresh warm garlic bread and salad and soup that we chose with our meals.  Calamari was delicious appetizer.  The stuffed chicken marsala with mashed potatoes was rather mediocre nothing special and it like cooked from a box...  The sirloin cooked medium rare with roasted squash was also rather bland peppered taste with side of fettuccini.  Probably best to just order their pasta dishes instead.  Overall a nice experience.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,777 NJ-18
21545,224,64,Italian,1,05/20/2018,"Never come here!  We went here for an early dinner/late lunch. From the start I should have left, the host looked as if she didn't want to be there and walked as if she had 100 lb boulders strapped to each foot, maybe it was just me.  After we our seated, our waitress comes.  We knew exactly what we wanted, appetizer with the salad and our entree.  Drinks came, but 20 minutes pass no food.  Appetizer came, no plates and no salad!  5 minutes after the app we get plates by then the app is cold.  Salad and plates come, there was enough salad to feed 1 adult.  Asked her to get us some more and she made a face, seriously?  You should see our waitress walk, looks like she has the same rock shoes as our host.  I've seen 50 year olds walk quicker.  She came in to our room 5 more times after and no salad?  Husband was so annoyed he didn't eat!  What's going on at this OG?",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,777 NJ-18

Dirty silverware and glasses, food does not taste the same and like it's supposed to, and the place as a whole seems like it needs a make over.

Ill say my food was tasty but i didnt want to eat it there... the waitress was rude, we got salad i asked for no cheese on it and she told me she would be making the salad at the table so i thought oh cool! I dont like dressing on my salad, idk if its custom to bring out a soggy mess of brown salad with god knows what kind of vinager all over it but i looked at her and said i wouldn't like any after she lied about making it at the table , my fiances food came out cold as well as she was too concerned with the 3 ladys next to us, and even before we order our drinks even though the table was in my name she completley ignored even trying to speak to me (i really dont think i look that scary im actually pretty friendly, usually, especially being a waiter myself for so long, i was disappointed i love talking to the wait staff! *sadface*)  i feel like my wine was also watered down..  it tasted weird, and after our food came out, this is why i wanted really pack up and leave, flies followed the young woman out. Idk if its stressfull managment that makes it super comperitive for the staff and just a dirty restaurant with lax rules about letting food sit out but i was really not impressed. It was upsetting sinse we dont get to go out as often and thought we had chosen a nice resturant to go to, as i dont cook my fiances favorite feducini alfredo... we were both sick all morning... i hope olive garden reads this as i was sure that managment wouldnt do anything about this horrible experience.

This East Brunswick location has a feel of old tired diner, everything starting with waiters, service, food, and the feel of the place is simply off. Food wise we had alfredo pasta which was ok, and chicken piccata that was dry and sour. Salad before that you can't even choose a dressing for, they simply give you house vinegar or something.

21608,287,64,Italian,4,05/19/2020,"Very good Italian restaurant suitable for both vegetarians (must confess though that eggs might be used in some preparations so if you are a pure vegetarian this may not be your hangout) and non-vegetarians. My family has been a near-regular customer at this restaurant for the past several years. Almost every kind of food prepared except for bruschetta could have dairy products so may not be ideal for vegans.    Harbinger  You always have an initial sampler plate of fresh baked soft bread irrespective of what you want to order next and you could ask for more of the bread. I usually like to ask for a small plate of about a tablespoon of additional olive oil for dipping and enjoying this soft bread along with other condiments like crushed pepper, black pepper and salt.    Appetizers  An amazing and tantalizing varieties are available - my personal favorities are -  1. Succulent Spinach-Artichoke dip with bread accompaniment  2. Mouth watering Lasagna Fritta (this is a must have!)  3. Superb Bruschetta bread with a nice side dish of fine and juicy minced tomato, basil and light vinaigrette which you can add to the top of the bruschetta bread    Main course  For the order of any main course item you get a choice of either a minestrone soup or salad but  I would suggest you go for the salad - it is really so deliciously prepared and so far I have never been able to find anyone else preparing such a delicately well balanced salad!  Of course, I am not going to reel out the main course menu here but some of my personal favorites -  1. Eggplant Parmigiana  2. Four cheese ziti  3. Fettuccini Alfredo    Desserts  Many ones worthy of relishing by a king available. Some of my personal favorites -  Cheesecake  Tiramisu    Service  Very courteous and well suited for families and large groups!    Finale  You shall, on the whole, not regret your trip and your family shall heap accolades on you for your really good choice!    Before you go  Now waste no time in food indulgence!!",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,777 NJ-18

The food was great, huge family sized portions. The waitress was attentive to all of our needs and made great recommendations. We had the wings, mussels, calamari and Caesar salad for appetizers and the lobster and chicken special for our mains and had SO much left over. Leaving the restaurant with to go boxes looked like we were catering a party. So happy we decided to celebrate here.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
21990,1,66,Italian,5,12/20/2022,"My wife and I shared an accidentally massive meal here our first night in the city. The Cesar Salad is wonderful, more than enough for 2 or 3 people. We shared some mussels in a white sauce that was good as well. The serving of lasagna that was brought to us was large enough to feed two families. It was delicious, but massive. We were told that one main dish was enough for two people. It's enough for two families. We really enjoyed the meal, but come in hungry and ready for massive portions.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway

They brought out tap water with no ice. It was warm. We got the chicken wings, lasagna and steak. The chicken wings had no favor at all. The lasagna was cold and the steak was so hard and burnt we couldn’t even eat it. The only good thing was the manager came over after the waitress saw we didn’t eat the steak and they took the steak off the bill.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway

His dedication to our request and service was beyond outstanding.  He is truly a full representation to a first class dining experience.  Only thing Carmine’s needs to improve on is offering half portions for couples as this is a family style portion servings, but hey we get a few left over lunch and dinners !",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway

From the gentleman helping you with the door at the entrance to the waiters and the food, I could not ask for more!!  Wether it is with your family, friends or in a group, you’ll enjoy every minute in this place.    With a nice and varied list of wines, the food was the center piece!  Amazing truly authentic Italian cuisine served in big plates to easily share among 4. In our case one salad plate and a pasta plate fed us 4 and couldn’t finish it!  As such, the price becomes affordable and you get great tasty Italian meal    There are a number of locations for this restaurant around the area and Im sure they will all exceed your expectations as well    Tip: they do not take walk ins, so make sure to make a reservation in their website in advance.  Also, as for everything in the area, the business does mot have parking.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway

But they have multiple branches in the city. The interior has this family style Italian vibe, there is outdoor seating as well.    Service: they are all super nice, they treat you as family here.    Food: Everything was good. CHICKEN SCARPARIELLO (wings): this is my favorite, the sauce on that juicy chicken is so delicious. You have to ask for wings tho! It taste better than thighs. CALAMARI: another favorite! Huge sizes of calamari fried into perfection! FRIED ZUCCHINI: omg it is so light and you can eat everything without getting full. CHICKEN ALLA ROMANA: the chicken was tender and juicy, the potatoes are perfectly cooked as well. GARLIC BREAD: you have to pay for this, its not free. But the bread is toasted good, you can chose with melted cheese or regular. PENNE ALA VODKA: the pasta was perfectly cooked, the sauce you can noticed its freshly made. GARLIC and OIL with CLAMS: this is one of my favorites too, cause its just simple with a lot of clams. TIRAMISU: best tiramisu, not that sweet and its huge.    Price rating: 8/10, it is not that bad for the amount of goodness you can have. Its very huge servings!    Will definitely come back because everything was good!

22000,11,66,Italian,5,01/19/2023,Expensive but amazing! Leftovers for days if you’re ordering. Looks like a small portion but it’s a LOT more than you think. Family portions. Everything was amazing!!!    Be sure to NOT use the reservation box below with the link. It doesn’t work. Just make sure you go during lunch because it’s less crowded! Amazing place though.

22001,12,66,Italian,5,05/19/2022,"This place has been a family favorite for some time now.    Food is ALWAYS Fresh, MADE-TO-ORDER & full of authentic Italian flavors and old world traditions.  Went with a family member. A complimentary assortment of fresh baked breads (seen in pic) with olive oil and butter on the side...  Crisp refreshing Pellegrino (our waiter was a gem! Got my usually requested citrus wedges (pic) to compliment my drink)    The appetizer, Stuffed Mushroom Caps (pics) is simply heaven! You can see all the herbs, red peppers etc in the picture.  Chicken Parmigiana (pics) consist of 2 extra large pieces of premium white meat chicken cutlets, topped a rich and authentic savory marinara sauce and quality cheese(s).    Lastly, but definitely NOT the least ..is one of my family members favorites..  Penne Alla Vodka full of saucy goodness, herbs, onion, garlic and topped with grated cheese.    Granted, THIS restaurant is NOT a place where you will find dollar menus, 2/$20 deals where you share an appetizer.... BUT you get what you pay for! Food is fresh, made when your waiter/waitress places your order, arrives to you hot & delicious with ALL the flavors in tact..  You get HEFTY, PLENTIFUL AND FAMILY SIZED PORTIONS ON HUGE PLATTERS (See for yourself in the pics)  MORE than enough that unless there's 3-4 ppl dining, you will DEFINITELY have food leftover to bag up for home. Definitely a great value for quantity and quality!!! A great family environment",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway

Then the entrees penne Ala vodka sauce and a breaded chicken breast with Mozzarella cheese and spinach with red potatoes and a lemon like sauce.  Food was great except for wings had feathers on them and we sent them back. I would have given them 5 stars on everything except for the wings and we were not given our calamari and garlic bread along with our to-go pans. I complained about it and we were given a $25 gift card for our food that was discarded when my dude paid $200 for the meal. I was highly disappointed as we go to this establishment at least every 3 to 4 months......this has really changed our view of this establishment.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway

The wait staff was super efficient and extremely friendly & attentive! Considering the amount of people they had to serve all at once, we were treated on an individual basis! Awesome!

One thing I would recommend is to go with a lot of people because of the portion size.    Everything was great until I got home I had the worse stomachache and was throwing up. And this was my only meal for the day so I know nothings else have caused my stomach bug.    There was so much food left over I took it home, so I’ll try again tomorrow and see if I have the same reaction with my stomach.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22011,22,66,Italian,2,06/23/2022,"I’ve eaten from this location before but it was only take out.  I visited Carmines Upper West Side with a large group in early June 2022 to celebrate my daughter’s graduation.  Due to the amount of people attending we were considered a large group (over 15 people).  Because of large number, I was informed we had to order off the prefix menu.  Jennifer assisted me with this, she was available to answer any questions/concerns I had.  I was emailed a contract and paid the deposit to hold our reservation.  I was given 3 days (72 hrs.) to the date of the event to confirm the final count of guests attending.  Upon arriving to the restaurant, we were greeted.  I also gave my cake to the greeter and informed it needed to be refrigerated. Within a few minutes of our reservation time, we were seated.  The waitress Tenice came over to take our order this made me question whether we could have just been a walk in.  I informed our waitress we have a prefix menu (contract).  I was very displeased with the lack of communication of the restaurant with our waitress Tenice.  Especially since we were told we couldn’t just walk into the restaurant and order since we were a large group.  I also wasn’t pleased as another waiter began to bring out soda beverages without asking what our preference was.  I had to ask him which beverages he had and requested him to remove some of the beverages he already bought out.  The appetizers of Caesar Salad and Garlic Bread were delicious.  For pasta we chose penne ala vodka which was very salty, and linguine with butter and oil which was just okay.  For entrees we chose shrimp scampi which everyone said was really good and chicken lemon and butter which seemed really rubbery.  For desserts we chose fresh fruit which was good and cheesecake which many didn’t like.  When it was time to bring out the cake, Tenice informed me there was a cake cutting fee per person.  I informed her Jennifer informed me the fee would be waived since we were a large group.  It took the staff 5-10 minutes to find my cake.  I had to show Tenice a picture of the cake.  The restaurant also didn’t have the sparklers so they put regular birthday candles in the cake.  I don’t appreciate the restaurant not communicating with our waitress and I feel like it was very unprofessional.    I felt like it should have been a stress-free day for me. Instead, I felt I was constantly directing and asking questions.  I put no blame on Tenice she was excellent.  The restaurant really dropped the ball on this one.  I’m not sure if I’ll dine at Carmines again on a prefix menu since it was out of order and not organized.  I was also told since we were a large group, they don’t serve the food.  Some of the guests didn’t like that we had to keep asking to pass this or that.  They offer both indoor and outdoor dining.  To get up to the main dining room we had to go upstairs, I didn’t notice any accessible ramp.  The restaurant is accessible via public transportation.  I’m only giving 2 stars for Tenice.  I really feel like we were cheated out of our money.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22012,23,66,Italian,5,09/21/2022,"This place is absolutely incredible. The atmosphere was immaculate and felt perfectly Italian-American. The group got a Caesar salad, eggplant parmesan & one of the specials of the day - pasta carbonara. There was plenty of bread for everyone, and the food ended up being around $24 a person with tip for six people.

22014,25,66,Italian,5,05/19/2022,"With reservations there was still a bit of a wait at the entrance so be prepared, however this was a Saturday night and considering covid protocols it actually wasn't so bad. When we entered we were seated in a beautiful eating area and the ambiance was perfect. The food was amazingly delicious, garlic bread cheesy and tasty, and the drinks were on point. The servings here are huge, there was just 2 of us and we barely finished. Great spot for groups or families. Prices are very reasonable considering location and portion size.

Overall a nice experience.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22020,31,66,Italian,3,03/20/2023,"Food:  We ordered the giardinera and the shrimp with white sauce pasta, the garlic bread with cheese as appetizer, Carmine's colada for drink and the half italian cheesecake.    The pasta was tasteless. As someone that cooks and loves pasta, if you want tasteful pasta avoid these dishes. They tastes like uncooked pasta, seems the pasta is not being left to sit on sauce enough so it can absorb it (big no no when you are cooking pasta).    The garlic bread was good, so were the Coladas.    The italian cheesecake is way too sweet.    Note that the food is provided on large portions so, I would not recommend ordering more than a course if you have a party of less than 4 people.    Service:  The service staff was amazing! From the server at the entrance and the entrance staff to our table server. Toshana is simply outstanding!! The waiters as well were very nice and even interacted with us when removing the dishes.    Atmosphere:  The atmosphere was comfortable but if you are looking for a restaurant where you can easily chat with your party, it can be challenging as some tables are extremely loud and its really hard to listen to the people in your table.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22021,32,66,Italian,5,05/19/2022,Excellent tasting Italian fare with huge volumes of food served family style.

We ordered the Ragu and the chicken scallopini. I liked the Ragu and had to add a bit of salt to the chicken for flavor. We had the stuffed mushrooms for the appetizer which was good, but I believe they gave me a stomach ache. #TummyAcheSurvivor",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22024,35,66,Italian,5,05/19/2022,Make a reservation! We were seated right away with ours Staff is so fun and amazing. Our waitress was very honest about the faves and portion sizes. It was just my daughter and I. We had calamari and penne ala vodka and could barely finish half. I felt terrible over the waste. We were headed to a show and couldn’t take the leftovers with us. Next time we will save it for after the show so we can take them lol! My only recommendation would be to have a half’s portion on the menu (which would still feed 2  Or 3). Great atmosphere. We will be back and bring reinforcements to finish the food haha!,Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway

Arrived 4:40 for my pickup and was told it would be another 10 minutes but ended up waiting an extra 40 minutes and was treated terribly by the manager who was screaming and yelling at customers waiting to pickup their orders. I had heard him telling customers take it or leave it and do you want it or not? When it came to my turn he told me he would check on my order and never returned. He was extremely rude and raised his voices unnecessarily. Hope they learn how to treat customers because the food is delicious but not worth the hassle and abuse from staff.    Update: after getting home and opening up my order. It is missing the baked clams and this is what the $22 bread pudding looks like.,Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway

22034,45,66,Italian,5,04/19/2023,"Everything you’ve read is true. Massive portions, delicious frozen cosmos wings you must get and a volume of a very busy New York restaurant.    There are two things I think you should be prepared for. The first, is the staff. They just are. they’re not happy they’re not warm , they just are. They are efficient and fast. And then there is dessert… I don’t know most people that go to Carmine‘s and have room for dessert but if there is a group of you order one dessert and split it, you won’t regret it.    While I frequent both this location and the Times Square location as a New Yorker my preference is this location because you don’t have the tourists or the tightness of the restaurant in Times Square. What the Times Square location does have that this one severely lacks is their manager Percy.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway

Some dishes were a really nice size portion and easy to share, while others like the chicken parm were much smaller, not a great value for the price, and difficult to share.

The made up for the potatoes by giving us a plate of new potatoes. Overall great experience and the staff was great.    We went back to Carmines on 11/23/22 for a pre Thanksgiving dinner with my girlfriend, her daughter and her daughter's boyfriend.  Great time and great food as always. Only one hiccup.

Service sometimes is not on point and the waitstaff is rude sometimes but you make do here because the food is yummy. Did I mention that already?    Caesar salad dressing is the best I've tasted. The bread pudding is very good and I don't even like chocolate! Their sauces are delicious and their pastas good too. The only thing not so great is the sometimes overly oily white sauces.  This is a great place for families.  At least five can eat one of their plate orders easily and the cost would is affordable if you do it this way.

22050,62,66,Italian,5,11/20/2022,"My Mom and I went for dinner. We had a 6.00 reservation, arrived a little early and was seated at 6:00 sharp. This was a pleasant surprise because the place was packed for a Sunday evening.. We were seated and ordered the baked clams appetizer which was delicious.. I didn't care for the complimentary bread. It was a basket of mixed breads (mostly rolls) which in themselves were good however they had some type of red spread on most of them and because the bread was served cold it didn't taste good. The waitress did not take the entree order  order right away so there was a 30 minute wait in-between the appetizer and the main entree (which was a little disappointing).. Nonetheless the steak came and it was delicious.. The best steak I've ever had..I was somewhat disappointed that the steak was cooked medium well when I specifically said I wanted well done meat and that I did not want to see any pink in the meat..I literally had a full conversation with the waitress.. Interesting enough when the waitress came and asked how was everything My Mother said fine and she went on to educate me that the meat was cold medium well so now I would know for next time.. At that time I politely explained to her that although the steak was good I specifically asked for well done and that was not how the steak was prepared..She did not seem to care..  All in all she was helpful with the wine selection and she did bring us some semi warm bream bread upon request.. The bill came to 192.00..  We had a 45 oz porterhouse steak.  Sliced and fried potato (which was good as well)  Baked clams  2 cups of tea  1 glass of wine..  All in all it was a good meal.  The atmosphere was bustling with people and chatter and low music.. It's a vibe  but my one complaint about the environment is that they have to many tables. I understand you wanting to maximize the space but when you have it so packed that people cannot walk by without hitting someone's seat then that is a problem. The back of my chair was hit at least 5 times which is somewhat disruptive..  Overall I would go back because the food was good..  Lastly..The steak was big enough for us to eat and pack individual to go containers so I will have steak, eggs and potatoes for brunch tomorrow!",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22051,63,66,Italian,5,05/19/2022,Excellent place for family style gathering. To share a meal with friend and family.

22057,69,66,Italian,3,02/18/2023,"Didn't make any reservations so it took them about 5-10 mins to seat 2 adults and 2 kids, because they were looking for a place to ""seat us"", mind you, it was close to closing so I didn't see what the wait really was about, because the place was 30% full . The food didn't take long to come, about 20 mins. In the meantime we were served deliciouzzz assorted slices of breads (forgot to take a pic). The quantity of the food was great. Big enough dishes to share with the fam, and even took home some left overs. But the spaghetti and meatballs wasn't what I expected. The kids liked it but my bf and I didn't. The flavor was missing something, and the texture of the meatballs, I didn't really care for along with the marinara sauce. The lasagna was deliciouzzz, the bread was delicious, and the dessert (chocolate cake with vanilla icecream) was delicious, and the drinks were delicious. They didn't give us a salad this time, but yet again, we never went to that location before. The waitress was cool, she checked on us about 2 times, we were their for about an hr. The bill wasn't that bad, if my memory serves me correctly I would say, nomore than $200 was spent, $140 range (I just gave her a $23 dollar tip).Overall it was a cool scene.

I am generally a big fan of family style food because of the amount I eat.  This was my first time trying their chicken parm and it was quite good.  The lasagna was decent as well, but not really my thing.  I can’t fault the restaurant on this because I am not one who orders lasagna, this was mainly for the others in my group.  While the service could have been a little faster, it was a very busy night for them so I can understand it taking some time.  I would definitely come back again with my group, but for sure order something else in substitution with the lasagna.

I had to ask my husband to remind me of the name of the restaurant because it didn't stand too out. The food is family style to bring your appetite, BUT the food (in my opinion) isn't something really to write home about. It was decent but I'm not raving about it. The one thing that really bothered me was how cramped it was. It's funny how such a spacious restaurant had such little elbow room. They really stacked the tables so close together. Definitely fun for a family time out with family style dining but I'm not going out of my way to go there.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway

22071,84,66,Italian,1,02/18/2023,I have never been to a worse restaurant in my life. The food was really really bad. No taste. The tables were falling apart and some of us had to hold our plate because there wasn't enough room on the multiple broken tables they pushed together while we waiting in the middle of the restaurant. One of our party tipped the lady a big tip to seat our party. The place had to be over occupancy. It was Covid city from the time we entered. No organization... Just a horrible $985.00 experience. Taste like school cafeteria food.  How do they maintain such a high rating? I'd never go back and would never recommend it to my enemy. They should be shut down!!!,Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway

Perhaps an apology or some accommodation like an offer for a glass of wine or we’ll drink could have saved the day, but clearly this establishment doesn’t care about its customers.

We attempted to order a bottle of wine and obviously presented our ID's. I've always renewed my license online, so it is still a vertical(under 21 license) instead of horizontal. I am 25 years old. The waiter refused to serve me alcohol because of this. Dozens of bars/clubs have never given me an issue b/c of my ID.  I thought he was joking, but he offered to ask management for me. He comes back and lets me know that it is a strict policy and that they wont budge. There is no law or regulation that states an individual cannot be served alcohol due to the orientation of their license. Furthermore, he comes back with my friend's wine in a water glass. I do not understand the rational behind that. He also never came to check up on us after ordering.

We order baked clams they where very salty and also the sauce that they served it in is usually thick but this time it like they just put cold  chicken broth . The waiter who served us poor my wine all over the white cloth never bother to ask if it is ok to leave it like . As for the main course we order a butter veal , it was to watery as well , and to lemony for our taste . The second main course we order was linguine with clams the portion of the clams it so small how ever pasta swim in salty as well sauce . Maybe the chef is not the same but it definitely not worth what I pay for .  When we left the place my son told me that he does not want to celebrate his birthday in this restaurant anymore.

Some highlights - Waited 10 minutes for our drink order to be taken (table across from us, came in after us, and were enjoying cocktails while we still waited to order ours).  When our meal arrived they brought the wrong order.  We were told we'd have to wait 15 minutes for them to correct THEIR mistake; fortunately it only took 10.  Had to ask our server 3 times for the check, we even boxed our own left-overs to get the whole process moving. The food was tasty but not exceptional.

Nice wine. I am so thankful !",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22087,100,66,Italian,5,12/20/2022,Very good food. Portions are to share. Good service. Highly recommended.,Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22088,101,66,Italian,2,01/19/2023,"The garlic bread was nice. The serving size was great but the food was extremely ordinary and nothing special. However, the service was horrible. You had to wait 10-15 minutes if you want something and calling the waiter is like playing a difficult (but not enjoyable) game. I don’t recommend at all.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22089,102,66,Italian,5,03/20/2023,"Pedro was amazing! It was his first day serving and he absolutely killed it. Food was great. Service was fantastic. And, I would 10/10 recommend! Honorable mention, Adrianne!",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22090,103,66,Italian,2,01/19/2023,"Appetizers (Fried zucchini, Garlic bread) were both very good. The mains (Chicken parm, Spaghetti with meatballs) were atrocious. The meatballs have a fruity, cheesy flavor. The chicken parm has virtually no seasoning and is covered in too much cheese. Our server was given a huge party, so she didn’t pay much attention to us. We waited 7 minutes for her to greet us and 1 hour to get our dinners. Would never recommend.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22091,104,66,Italian,5,04/19/2023,"The staff was the best part of this experience. They were so kind and accommodating. I really enjoyed the atmosphere as well. My food choice was not my taste, but I also have a partial palate. I’m sure the other items were good because it’s all made fresh.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22092,105,66,Italian,5,03/20/2023,"This is a 100/10 for me. The food was delicious, and the waiter was so kind, patient, and quick. The atmosphere was also very welcoming I will be coming back (Be mindful that it is served family style)",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22093,106,66,Italian,3,03/20/2023,"As many years as I've been going to Carmine's, this was the worst experience ever! We arrived about 45 minutes before our reservation time (7:30 pm) and weren't seated until 8:25pm. We were told there were 7 people ahead of us, but several parties walked in and were seated immediately. The hostess was very unfriendly and unprofessional. Her and the woman handling take-out chit-chatted and passed snacks amongst themselves and other staff members. When asked about the time frame of being seated, she barely wanted to check and said, ""soon."" The food was just subpar and very disappointing. We brought most of it home to ""doctor"" it up because it was so bland. It's totally different than I've ever experienced before.  Carmine's is nothing like it used to be over the years. From having security at the door to the unwelcoming staff and food taste quality. Just a disappointing experience.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22094,108,66,Italian,2,12/20/2022,"The food was cold.  I have been a customer of carmines in times square for 5 years and had a bad experience at carmines in upper west. No bread to wait for food, no cheese. The waiter never served me and in the end he asked me for a tip. I do not recommend!",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22095,109,66,Italian,1,05/05/2023,"The waitress was amazing, the food not so much. I am not sure why this is a popular italian place in the city. This hot appetizer plate looked not appetizing at all and our pasta was bitter. The chicken cutlet wasn't bad.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22096,110,66,Italian,2,01/19/2023,"I come to the restaurant quite often and unfortunately today I was surprised with a not very friendly reception. As we arrived 30 minutes in advance we asked if it would be possible to anticipate and the receptionist was not clear if it would be possible to anticipate or not (I speak English well).  talking to her and having many tables that were not occupied, we noticed that a party of three, the same as mine, who arrived late for the reservation was immediately seated.  A shame that the restaurant has this treatment for some customers.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22097,111,66,Italian,5,04/28/2023,"Amazing service, amazing food & amazing time. From start to finish the were pleasant, attentive to detail and made my best friends birthday grand. Bar staff amazing. Toshanna & Gabby top notch. Will definitely be back with more people",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22098,112,66,Italian,5,03/20/2023,Carmine's still remains a great Italian restaurant with amazing food that can be shared family style. I tried the Giardiniera with Rigatoni. It was a scrumptious vegetarian meal that was truly filling. I definitely plan on returning to indulge in the next satisfying meal I can try.,Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22099,113,66,Italian,5,03/20/2023,Awesome food and great service from our server Chris. Eating at Carmines was definitely the best dining experience of our trip to NYC. Not fancy but very enjoyable atmosphere and wonderful food! Just what we were hoping for. Thanks Chris.,Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22100,114,66,Italian,2,12/20/2022,The good: The food was excellent. We had the appetizer sampler abd the chicken Marsala. Portions are for groups of 3 to 4. We were only 2 so we had a lot of leftovers. The bad: The service left more to be desired. The waiter was nice but not attentive. We had to find him and flag him down whenever we needed anything. No on cleaned our table until we asked. There were so many plates and no one picked them up. The waiter did not know the menu nor did the kitchen. We made it clear to the waiter we did not eat pork. We asked if the appetizer had pork and he said no. Then we are served pancetta. Which is ham pretty much. The waiter tried to tell me that the pancetta was peppers. What? I had to dive into the menu to prove to him that it was pork since he didn't listen. Then he kept asking why we can't eat pork. That is none of your business. If I'd like to share with you then fine but you should not pry.  It was very unprofessional. On top of that we ordered a bottle of wine and weren't given wine glasses. He wanted us to use our water glasses. So now we had no cup for water. When I asked for wine glasses he acted as if it was a problem. Telling me that the water glasses they use are steamless wine glasses. Which they are not. Not even close to a wine glass. Maybe the serve was inexperienced but he definitely put a damper on my experience.,Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22101,115,66,Italian,5,03/20/2023,I had an amazing waiter named Ernie. He greeted my party & I with a big smile. He told me & my party that he's only been at Carmine's for about six days. He patiently waited to take the orders of me & my 4 family members. He remembered each of our orders. He smiled at all of us & was genuinely engaging my whole family in good conversation. Everything we asked for he brought to us. He gets an A++ from me. A true asset to Carmine's on the upper west side. When I come back to Carmine's I am asking for Ernie. I had such an awesome experience at Carmine's & with my waiter Ernie. Last but not least the food was so delectable. My favorite dish was the penne Alla vodka. The sauce was creamy & flavorful. The seasoning on the pasta was spot on delicious. Wow!,Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22102,116,66,Italian,5,01/19/2023,"Food is always great! Server was rude. I don't usually say that, but he was obnoxious. He actually said to us that he has 7 tables and he'll get to us when he can. The place wasnt even that busy. I was very surprised. It will not affect me returning, but I will never sit in his area again.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22103,117,66,Italian,5,05/19/2021,"Love love love this restaurant! No matter how many times I eat here I am always happy with the service, the wait staff, and the food and drinks! Always the best!",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22104,118,66,Italian,2,01/19/2023,"Food took an awful long time to arrive and the servers could not care less about your time there or your comfort. Expensive for no reason as well as a subway running underneath the building causing your table to shake. However, when the food arrived it was decent.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22105,119,66,Italian,2,05/19/2021,"Place was... different. The family size portions are nice. Felt like we had Friendsgiving in May. Our table however was all the way in the back in a corner on the right side. If someone at the end of the table had to get up, everyone on that side had to get up. That’s how tight the space was. We barely had space to fit the food on the table when it came. We went on a Tuesday and surprisingly the place was pretty crowded. Seems like they were over the covid limit. They did have plastic barriers between the table but let’s all be real, them things don’t do much of anything. Their drink menu is limited and drinks aren’t made consistently. I mean it’s an Italian restaurant so they do have a lot of wine. When it comes to mix drinks the selections weren’t that good in my opinion. I got a glass of moscato the first round and the whole table (8) ordered margaritas for the second round. ALL the margaritas tasted different. It’s either they don’t have a set recipe that they follow and they’re just free pouring or it’s multiple bartenders doing their own thing. Some drinks, like mine, were very tangy and sour while some was sweeter. All the drinks are suppose to taste the same every time. Also it was kinda loud. There was a lot of birthdays yes but the atmosphere was not what I expected. The bathrooms needed more attention. They should have someone cleaning in there regularly throughout the day. It seems like they were a bit short staff that night. The food itself tasted okay. The calamari could have been seasoned and the shrimp linguini didn’t have much flavor. Maybe I’ll try a different location next time. Overall the experience was ok.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22106,120,66,Italian,5,05/19/2021,"I had the penne alla vodka and it was delicious! They serve family style here, so the dishes are meant to be shared. I found the portions to be very generous for the price. I actually visited here by myself and left with 2 leftover meals. Definitely give Carmine's a try!",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22107,121,66,Italian,4,04/19/2023,This used to be the spot we I used to go to all the time for birthdays. Its still wonderful family style portions. I love the titanic the dessert. I would get it with just two people its a bit overkill but the chocolate cake on the bottom with all the chocolate ice cream and whip cream is !!!!!,Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22108,122,66,Italian,2,12/20/2022,"Carmine's has been my family's go to Italian restaurant for years. We've dined in and ordered take out. When vistors come to town, Carmine's is our first choice. Unfortunately, for the very first time I have to give a low rating. I ordered almost $300.00 worth of food from the uptown restaurant and it was disappointing. The food just wasn't good. I ended up throwing away one of my favorite dishes, Chicken Scarpariello. The breading on the Shrimp & Chicken Parmesan would just not stay on and there was a lot of it. The only good thing was the garlic bread. I could go on and on, but you can get the picture. I don't know who was preparing the food on Thursday evening, December 15th, but they fell short. Sorry, but I will not be ordering from Carmine's for a while.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway

We made reservations about 6 months in advance for 6:30pm, got there around 6:15 and we sat down right around 6:30.  Our waiter's name was Drew and he was amazing!  Gave us recommendations and was super helpful.  Our drinks were never empty and they cleared our table and brought us clean plates as needed.  The food was great, we were so full we didn't even have room for dessert.  I highly recommend going here!",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22110,124,66,Italian,1,02/18/2023,"If you are looking for a restaurant that will honor your reservation and seat you on time this isn’t the place for you.    Saturday night we had a reservation for a large party (carmines specialty) for jj husbands birthday.  We arrived on time.  After waiting for 20 minutes we asked when we would be seated and we’re told RUDELY that there are lots of parties ahead of us and it would be a whole, likely not until 9:30pm, and HOUR PAST OUR RESERVATION time.  That is completely unacceptable so we left.  And the restaurant had the nerve to mark us as a no show on open table.  Will never be coming back again.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22111,125,66,Italian,2,05/19/2021,"This was my first time there, I got the lunch special rigatoni bolognese. It lacked flavor and was very oily. It might be because it was the lunch special and they didn’t care or this is the norm but it didn’t hold up to the price at all. I’ve made better pasta at home and the pasta from the pizza shops is better too. I’m disappointed smh. The person taking the Togo orders was super nice and informative since it was my first time. 5 stars for him.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway

We had a party of 3 people. My husband & our older son got upset about it as well as I did. They seemed to want to take the larger crowds. I also, got sick after eating the meatballs. I was sick the whole next day. Our server was more occupied with the larger groups as well. Not a good experience there, all away around.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22113,127,66,Italian,5,02/18/2023,"Five stars because the food menu disappoints but service would only get one star. The busboys were more attentive than our server. I’d blame it on the fact that it was pretty busy, however tables that were seated after us were served before us even though we were a smaller group.  I’ll stick to the Times Sq location.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22114,128,66,Italian,5,05/19/2021,"Oh man oh man. The food is phenomenal! The spaghetti and meatballs!! Wow. The lasagna! Wooooow. So fresh, so much flavor. Portions are huge, 1 plate can feed 3 ppl.

22116,130,66,Italian,5,04/19/2023,"Tyler, one of the managers, was ""on"" us, assisting my disabled mother, before I realized who he was. I thought he was just a kind customer. I had to go to the bank and returned to tip him for his attentiveness.    Food is always great. BUT! You cannot done alone, unless you want to treat the food as a pre-cooked, and paid food service; for you will eat for at least a week!    My favs are tiramisu, Caesar salad, and I've got to try the cheese toasted bread. Pasta sold separately, if you do the seafood.    The tiramisu seems to be a little lighter than years before, and is served differently - on a saucer - now. You can check out the picture on their website.    For those of you who've never been, please check out their website for prices. I'd hate to see you go and not have enough money.    I like to tip in cash, so that the wait staff isn't penalized due to bank card fees. Don't know if that happens to them, but just in case.    I'm partial to wait staff because I have waited tables, too, long ago. Those plates, and serving dishes are HEAVY! And they carry them as if they were paper towels, so please don't play them cheap. If your meal costs $300, 20 percent is $60. You want to give more? It's always appreciated, especially during these times.    Always crowded.

Yesterday around 4:30 I went to the 19th street restaurant branch and it started off with a very rude waitress he had no patience with us and wouldnt let us order he later switched our waitress to a young man and it was a lot better, fast forward an hour we asked for the check, he brought it and i gave him my card and asked him to add the titanic sundae on the check as well he brought out the sundae but not my card, after about 40 minutes of asking for my card he finally brought my card, around 8am i got an alert that someone had tried to take $4397 dollars to buy stuff. I know its from here because I hadnt used my card anywhere else and he had my card for over 40 minutes. I called the manager and reported it, he could care less he told me i dont really care Call the police and file a report if you want. Worst experience ever",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway

After decades of dining at Carmines we were surprised that each of the dishes were sub-par. The shrimp parm was cold, the marsala lacked zest, the linguini & clams was watery and the country style pasta barely had taste. The calamari was so rubbery it was difficult to chew, the only dish we enjoyed is their signature scarpariello wings. After many years of fantastic delicious meals, we will chalk  up my Mom's 80th Bday celebration and hope this was just one bad night.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway

I was impressed as it had all sorts of fresh fruits such as sliced pears, walnuts were so delicious. Chicken & veal  parmigiana was exquisite. Pasta with garlic & olive oil was devine. It had whole cloves of roasted garlic. The meal was over 150.00 so be ready to pay for this scrumptious meal & worth it. PS I ate 2 meals at home n still had salad left over.

Myself and a friend went, ended up waiting an hour for our food, Carmines ruined our evening plans! We had to ask for a manager, who apologized and comped us for the food to his credit but when the penne alla vodka finally arrived it was cold and horrible! Felt like it had been heated up and tossed around on a pan for just a minute. We regretted not leaving and getting fast food instead, such a shame as we were really looking forward to our first carmines experience.

We picked up an order of veal parm and chicken scarpiello wings. Everything was over cooked. The veal was actually burnt. This was his birthday dinner. We were so disappointed. I reached out to Carmine’s non of the staff bothered to return my call or reach out to me. I believe we deserve restitution.,Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22133,150,66,Italian,3,05/19/2021,"Ok for a fancy place like this make sure you get reservations.   We ended up being seated outside under heat lamps and midway through our meal we just put or heavy coats back on in order to finish eating.  The waiter advised us each plate feeds about 2-4 people and he was spot on.  This was an expensive meal and the only complaint is when we initially bite into the lasagna we both looked at one another and said chef boy-r-d sauce, NO!  But, how could we both have this conclusion on the first bite.  Good news as we continued to eat this healthy sized $35.00 plate of lasagna, the traditional gravy/ sauce took over the flavor.  We assumed that the top layer maybe coated with the Chef to ensure a nice esthetic presence when serving?  Not sure why but either way we enjoyed the experience.   I would recommend this location, but inside or during better weather for the outside seating.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway

The food was cold & In complete when it came out. Ordered two pasta dishes and two meat/ seafood dishes. And after an hour after sitting the 1st things that came out was the pasta, everything else came out 1/2 an hour latter after pleading with numerous waiter that the kids were hungry and were falling asleep.

22141,160,66,Italian,1,05/19/2021,"An absolute disgrace, I went there with my partner for our Anniversary for a nice dinner. Everything was fine at first, our reservation was upheld and we were seated shortly after arrival (note, there were 3 empty tables around us). We sat down and ordered at 8:40, the tables around us filled up around 8:50. It's 9:20 and our food has not come, however, all three of the tables that were seated after us, had their food already. We continued to wait, and after an hour of waiting for the food, the pasta is hard. I waited for out waiter to come back and he didn't, I had to get up and go look for a manager. The manager questioned my claim, but said he would get me another one. I continued to wait for my new food to come out, by the time my food came out, every table around us was leaving, the same tables that arrived after my partner and I. When the order finally came out they wrapped it and taped the bag, so we couldn't eat it. The manager did not check on us, nor did our waiter. I had to get up to request my check and my waiter was just standing in front of our table waiting for us to pay. We ordered penne a la vodka with chicken, when I opened my take home bag, it was penne a la vodka with SHRIMP. I am highly allergic, which prevents me from eating the pasta. We paid $70 to not eat any food and it ruined our anniversary. Everyone around us was treated better than us, I would never go back.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22142,161,66,Italian,4,04/19/2023,It’s great for groups. Messed up our order but fixed our plate. Decent food for the large portions and prices.,Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22143,162,66,Italian,5,05/20/2018,"Though apparently very strict when it comes to sitting your party only when everyone is present, they are very accommodating and almost psychic. When I went up to check in the second time to let them know that my party was all here, it was shortly past the 15 min cut off and they went ahead and called my party to sit as if they read my mind. It's a bit of a madhouse but there are plenty friendly staff to manage it. Out waiter was quite busy but very friendly and checked in at the right times. Never did we feel rushed to order the next course or to pay the bill or to leave. The food was substantial and delicious with the calamari and penne a la vodka as highlights. We finished off with the bread pudding and it was fantastic. We were a party of four and had one appetizer, two entrees, and one dessert (it's all family style) -- this was plenty of food for standard appetites. You may want an extra side or app for more hungry members of your party.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22144,163,66,Italian,5,05/20/2019,"Had a wonderful time, seated quickly. Drinks were tasty (glass of red wine). Orders were family style. Ordered 1 plate of calarmi and 1 order of pasta. It was more than enough for 3 adults and 1 child. However we aren't huge eaters. The waiter was nice. Recommended to have dinner here.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22145,164,66,Italian,3,04/19/2023,Decent food. My alcoholic drink was poured into a plastic cup.  Not the most terrible experience but far from the best,Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22146,165,66,Italian,5,05/19/2020,Simply amazing  the staff was super nice and the food was plentiful and phenomenal. Only word of advice I would say is they give you BIG portions so if it is just you and one other person I would even suggest sharing a main dish. Also they allow booking reservations online so consider that if you have a big party!,Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22147,166,66,Italian,5,05/19/2020,Omg amazing. Make sure you get a reservation! (Just because it minimizes the crazy wait time depending on the size of your party) Service was phenomenal. Food was amazing. But Bread pudding really surprised me. It was warm and hints of chocolate and raisins. I was in heaven!!,Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22148,168,66,Italian,1,05/19/2022,"If I could give minus stars for this restaurant I would. My family's experience was terrible and just not up to scratch for the money you are paying. There were multiple issues with the reservation we made at Carmines and the staff were very unhelpful which was  frustrating.    I had made a reservation for 7:30pm and arrived just before then so would not be waiting around in a crowd with covid and crazy lines for walk in. Upon arrival and checking in for my reservation the hostess said they will seat you when the table is ready.    In most restaurants if you make a reservation for a specific time, your table should be ready to seat you at that time or a couple of minutes later if they are running slightly behind. There was no sign of being called for the table after 20mins so I went to speak to the hostess and was given the line we don't have any tables available right now.. which seems ridiculous seeing as I had made a reservation. Another 10mins no call for seating so approached hostess again, same story very unhelpful.    My party was seated 45 minutes after my reservation time after checking with 2 hostesses multiple times. While waiting for the table there was a crowded area by the bar which did not feel covid safe and multiple people including the hostess at the top of the stairs was not wearing a mask - which is against the current NYC mask mandate. We had waited so long and were so hungry we sat down ready to order immediately after reviewing the menu which waiting for 45mins.    The waiter didn't take our order for 15mins which was a full hour after reservation time (8:30pm).    The wine glasses they brought to the table were dirty so had to ask for new ones. The service was so slow that the 2 bottles of wine were not served until halfway through the main course being eaten (after bread had been eaten as a starter) this was hugely disappointing, who wants a bottle of wine halfway through their main course? This should have arrived before the bread starter.    Asked for wine cooler as white wine was not cold, shoved bottle white wine on top of bed of ice instead of the correct way putting ice surrounding the bottle, 75% of bottle was on top of the ice outside the bucket. The 2 bottles of wine were not cheap so this was below average service as if the staff just didn't care. The table was uneven and crooked so the wine glass would have fallen over if it was left in the wrong spot.    Overall a terrible experience at Carmines. My family have eaten here previous years and had better memories but this was extremely disappointing and far below restaurant standards in New York. It was the worst place we ate while my family visited and the staff were not friendly or helpful at all.    Would NOT recommend.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22149,169,66,Italian,5,05/19/2022,Carmines is a great place to go with a large group. Don't underestimate the size of dishes. Even the smallest is huge! The lasagna is specially tasty.

We had to order shrimp scampi and hope that my daughter liked the shrimp scampi too. My daughter wanted certain type of noodles or pasta, but that type of noodles or pasta was not available (on the menu), so had to be pick a certain type of pasta that was almost similar to the noodles/pasta that my daughter preferred.

This time Charlie was our server and he is my absolute favorite server ever. He made the experience spectacular! Even if the food was awful (WHICH IT MOST DEFINITELY WAS NOT... PICTURES TO FOLLOW!!!!! ) I would return just to sit in his section he was friendly and funny and he made our friends first visit/birthday dinner truly special. He recommended some amazing dishes everything was perfect. The food and service is worth the trip and the wait (if you didn't make reservations) my God this was an amazing extraordinary dinner! I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for some amazing food and amazing service . I hope they never change... I also recommend this location more than the one on 44th...i promise you'll love it I've been coming here since 2003 every time beats the last.,Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway

22168,188,66,Italian,2,11/20/2022,"Ladies and gentlemen let me just start by saying it was a party of about 16 people we signed the contract indicating that there would be one entries two pastas to desserts and coffee for 60 bucks per person. We had to place our orders before we came into the restaurant to eat. Unfortunately we did not because we did not know exactly what we wanted to eat on that particular day. So upon arrival we were sat in our table and then the food started to come out, not my food what the food that other people ordered to be shared amongst us all. I quickly spoke to the waiter and asked him how could he be taken out food when we didn't order our food we placed our order and the food came out. But if you look at what they were offering for the price that we paid we did not get what we wanted. Carmines ripped us off. They gave us half the food but charges the full price and extra. I would love to include a copy of the menu but it doesn't allow me to do so here. If you have a chance look it up and see if your interpretation is the same as I interpreted for 60 bucks one entries two pastas dessert etc per person. Management wasn't accommodating whatsoever and I truly feel that I was ripped off as well as a family gathering. My advice watch and stay clear of that prepaid menu it's nothing more than a scam for Carmines to rip people off you never really get the food you pay for.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway

Nothing compared to the baked clams from Patricia’s of Tremont! We also had the shrimp parmigiana ($39.50, 12 pieces) with angel hair pasta ($12). The shrimp parm was exquisite!

Order a pasta with sausage and broccoli they added  a hand full of garlic that made the pasta taste only like garlic when it was a marinara sauce not good at all. Calamari’s was okay could of been better if they weren’t to dry and no flavor one lemon for a huge plate full of calamari’s .

Not noticing I stopped at the door to wait for my wife I the bathroom he immediately stopped behind me but I noticed and felt everything he was doing. As I looked and stared at him and the other waiter following him he went back up stairs and didn't know what to do.

22206,228,66,Italian,3,11/20/2022,"Nothing to write home about.  The food was pretty good, but the service was pretty lackluster. Waited an hour in an empty restaurant just to get Spaghetti and Meatballs, and the waitress we had was pretty avoidant the whole time. I'm sure it's not always like that, but I wouldn't go too far out of my way to dine here in the future.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway

Why have a reservation system that doesn't work. Asked to speak to manager, manager tells me their is nothing he can do, and walked away. Horrible system, Horrible manager.

22238,260,66,Italian,4,05/19/2020,The food and our waiter were excellent. However  I don't think you should have to wait an hour and 20 minutes when you have a reservation. The young man taking the check ins told us we were the third in line for a table of four. So all we could figure out was if a table of 5 left they would not seat us until another group of four left. This was the most absurd thing we have ever ran into. People were getting pretty angry by the time we got our table. They need to come up with a better solution for this location.,Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway

When we received our order of Bolognese Meat Sauce, the meat that was added on the pasta was delicious. However, the pasta was not cooked and not prepared properly. Also, 3 or 4 pieces of house bread that was given to us was hard and difficult to chew.

Do not go if you are not a party of 3-4 people minimum because the dishes are enormously big.  2. Be ready for a long waiting 50-60 min.

The doorman was very polite,  handsome as well as educated. honestly a lot of elegance and class! we did a bar tab for the club downstairs a bit expensive but totally worth it. The music (Latin music) was really really good. ALOT of fun and the vibe was simply incredible. In  my opinion one of  the BEST spots in NYC! The carmencita(cocktail) tasted wonderful! We had a blast and we will definitely be coming back! The servers and bartenders were very attentive and nice! Highly recommended!",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22255,277,66,Italian,3,05/19/2022,"Unfortunately, this Broadway location did not live up to the exceptional review I gave Times square location Pre-Covid. My daughter couldn't wait to try it on our trip after I raved about it. Everything was cold, even the bread, which was also wet for some reason. The noodles were hard. Not Al Dente, just hard. The sauce had a good flavor but as I bit into a cold piece of meat, I was done eating. I would still recommend this place as it is a good restaurant with affordable family style portions and I realize this one visit may just be a result of understaffed covid conditions. The staff was still delightful.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway

The wait was a little long (45 mins) but it's a Saturday night and I made NO reservations, so all things considered it was actually pretty impressive. Inside the place is busy and bustling with everything from birthdays, guys/girls night out, dates, and casual dining but the wait staff is on their ""A"" game and I felt like I was at small restaurant on a slow night. Our server was attentive, engaging, helpful, and then some. When our order came (pretty fast) one of the dishes was wrong and he quickly corrected and rectified the situation and was back with the right dish in seemingly no time. I'm not hard to please, but I'm also not easy to impress and while I mostly have very positive dining experiences, Carmine's just blew my whole mind.  I'll be back ASAP.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22263,286,66,Italian,5,05/20/2017,Unbelievably great!!! Huge portions always delicious. Great for large parties and celebrations. The starters are just as good as the entries. Cesar Salad and an extra large serving of fresh Calamari just to begin. Big board with all the selections. Something special not in the menu is their Chocolate Torte. Trust me it's in the back refrig. Usually a wait during dinner times. Friendly experienced staff. Delicious!!!,Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway

The server then explains that all is presented family style and it all makes sense.  The Calamari is so fresh tasting. It is crispy on the outside, soft and smooth on the inside and could easily serve a family of four as the main course. The tenderloin serves upwards of six with potatoes, asparagus and crispy onions on top.  The atmosphere is warm and welcoming while at the same time bustling with energy and happy diners who all declare their suprise at the size of the portions as the meals arrive at their tables before them. The staff are the same, warm, welcoming and full of energy.  Really an enjoyable experiance for family, friends and the more the merrier.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway

Have dined at both the Times Square and Upper West Side locations and found the food, service and atmosphere to be superb at both locations. At or last meal at the UWS location, I ordered the 45 ounce Porterhouse Pizzaioli and it was awesome.  Our server was David Valdez and he could not have been better - attentive without being intrusive.  The restaurant is loud and boisterous so be prepared for that, but it really just adds to the fun, festive atmosphere.

22279,302,66,Italian,5,05/20/2019,"Okay. Carmine's is an experience.    Atmosphere: It's not super fancy, and it certainly won't be a quiet ordeal. But if you want real, honest, solid pasta and great service, this is it. You'll generally see groups of 3 or more people, rather than just two-person tables. Their dishes are so big, you'll want a bunch of people to try a bit of everything.:)    Food: $22-30ish pasta dishes will probably feed a group of 3 easily, and be a pretty decent dish that tastes good and fresh and is filling. They seem to use real herbs too, not that dried-parsley-in-a-bottle, so every bite is a delight. I had the stuffed artichokes and the special pasta--Orecchiette in olive oil, with sun-dried tomato, broccoli rabe, sausage, and plenty of herbs (roasted garlic, parsley, etc.).    Service: we had a fantastic server who knew his stuff, was honest about recommendations, and hilarious to boot.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22280,303,66,Italian,5,05/19/2022,"Portions are huge, food is flavorful, service was quick and the waiters were friendly. There were 8 of us and we ordered 2 apps and 4 dishes. We all were able to take large portions of food home. The restaurant was thorough with vaccine checks. They also had a good amount of space between parties, which made us feel more comfortable dining inside. Overall, I would strongly recommend this restaurant.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22281,304,66,Italian,1,08/22/2022,"The service is really good. However the actual food is really below average. While the portion size is huge, thats all there is to it. The taste of the food is really bland. I think all the good reviews are just from the locals around, because this place really shouldn’t be 4.4 stars just based on the taste of the food alone.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22282,305,66,Italian,1,09/21/2022,"I ordered a bolognese pasta dish, I asked for it to come without cheese, even though it wasn't in the description.  The waitress commented that she was going to find out, just in case.  Since she wasn't sure, we changed and asked for pasta with tomato sauce and meatballs, specifying that it should be without cheese.  When they brought the pasta, it had cheese on top, I told the waiter that I ordered without cheese, he took the plate away and when he brought it back later, he informed me that the meatballs had cheese inside.  We were a table of 4, my friends had already been served their food, only then, after the second time the pasta dish was brought wrong, they offered me a non-dairy menu.  I stayed without dinner, because my food would arrive after my friends finished theirs.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22283,306,66,Italian,5,07/23/2022,One of my Favorite places to dine. Never disappointed  With Large portions.,Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway

22286,309,66,Italian,4,05/19/2021,We went here for my birthday and it was nice and the food was good too. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because the waiter forgot my mom's order and she gets turned off by that but the waiter did apologize.,Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22287,310,66,Italian,5,08/22/2022,Nice family oriented restaurant. Can dine in or out. Make reservations ahead of time. Food is served family style. The titanic desert is too die for. Make sure to go on an empty stomach. Clean restrooms. Street parking.,Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22288,311,66,Italian,5,05/19/2022,Food and service are great. The only thing was that there are stairs to go up the main dining area which made it a little hard for someone with kids to go up- the restaurant is very kid/family friendly which is great!!  Bring your appetite because food is great and tons of it! I appreciated the fact that they packed up blue cheese along with my leftover wings :) will definitely recommend!!!!,Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway

22291,314,66,Italian,5,08/22/2022,"Keep in mind the items ordered are LARGE portions. This would be ideal restaurant for groups or parties. If you have 4 or less in your party plan to only pick a couple menu items or be ready to pack alot of leftovers. We ordered the stuffed mushrooms they are bomb  a caesar salad which fed us 3 and enough for 3 more portions lol. Delicious caesar dressing anchovy paste and delicious. My mother ordered the chicken saltimboca and raved about it, me and my partner ordered the chicken parm with angel hair and it was amazing. Wonderful amount of melted cheese, their sauce is great as well. Service is great, little spendy but worth the price due to portion.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22292,315,66,Italian,3,09/21/2022,"I've been going to Carmines to celebrate my Birthday for many years. I have to say this time I was truly disappointed.  The waitress avoided us, the food came out ice cold, and overall, it was not a pleasant experience. Unfortunately, looks like I need to find a good replacement restaurant for future celebrations.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22293,316,66,Italian,4,07/23/2022,Consistently great food with huge portions. This is perfect for families or large groups. 1 meal can usual feed 2-4 people and the flavor is always on point.,Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22294,317,66,Italian,1,06/23/2022,"Food was good (ordered Country Style Rigatoni & Carmine's Salad) but service was horrible. Keep in mind, I'm a former food-server, so I always give the staff grace. We saw the waiter twice, once to take the order, and once when I hunted him down to get the check. No refills, no bread (until I requested from hostess), no dinner plates for our entrees, no bussing, no boxes for left overs, no offer to take dessert order, nothing. Then we waited almost an hour after we were done for the check. There are lots of good Italian restaurants on the Upper West Side, don't choose this one.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22295,318,66,Italian,1,06/23/2022,"Party of 6. Have you got 2 & half hours??  Demand not to get seated against the wall. It's a blind spot. Seriously!!  We got our drinks and hot antipasto.  We counted a party of 75 who's tables were prepared as we watched on with our kids. We also watched the party of 75. a party of 5, and a party of 7 all served apps, then mains, before I raised a voice.  A free dessert for the kids, The Titanic!  Very apt.  This place is definitely sinking.  Should have gone to Domino's!  Guess what, the 75 are starting to leave. Better ask for the check again.........",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway

22298,321,66,Italian,1,09/21/2022,Salmon was completely salty and scampi sauce had absolutely no lemon. Caesar salad was good but overall wouldn’t give this place a good rating. Too pricey for no reason and food was not even that good.,Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22299,322,66,Italian,3,12/20/2022,Food is not the same.  Meatballs taste like mush....tooo much bread crumbs.  Ordered shrimp with rigatoni.. no flavor.  I was soooo disappointed,Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway
22300,323,66,Italian,5,05/19/2020,"Best Italian on the UWS (maybe the city) I’ve been here several times but last Monday in particular I was dining alone, the waitress I had was charming as was the host.

Be sure that if you are ordering at lunch that it is infact the lunch menu though. We accidentally bought more food and it was $30 more than we expected! Still delicious, Tiina was a great server.",Carmine's Italian Restaurant - Upper West Side,2450 Broadway

The Chianti, bread, salad, grilled vegetables, lemon chicken and artichoke chicken was fantastic. Highly recommend visiting Arno for an unforgettable meal and dining experience.",Arno,141 W 38th St
22871,1,69,Italian,5,05/19/2021,First time to NY and Arno's did not disappoint.   Carlos was a wonderful host and the food was delicious. I was so hungry I forgot to take a picture of my entree.

22872,2,69,Italian,3,05/19/2020,"I came here today for my holiday lunch courtesy of my employers. I didn't know beforehand that this place is a ""sister"" restaurant to Delmonico's. This restaurant, just like Delmonico's is absolutely elegant and very clean. The food and drinks were pretty good as well. Everything came out pretty quickly after we finally ordered. The clam appetizer were a bit small where one person can eat the whole plate. My main course of red snapper was really tasty and my cheesecake was creamy.  The only issue (and I believe it is because of the holidays) is that the service was a tad slow. Waitstaff seem to disappear when you need them and nobody checks up to see if everyone is satisfied or if anyone needed anything. I would give this place another shot, only when it is less busy.",Arno,141 W 38th St
22873,3,69,Italian,2,05/19/2020,I went there for the murder mystery dinner. I don't recommend this act for anyone under the age of 55. It was very boring but the older people seemed to enjoy themselves. The food provided was very blah I would have preferred to eat in the actual restaurant. The seating was very tight and uncomfortable to watch the show. However it was a night out with something to do. I wouldn't do it again!! They did include me in the show and they called me beautiful numerous amount of time compliments are fantastic but I still wanted entertainment not to be bored.,Arno,141 W 38th St
22874,4,69,Italian,5,05/19/2022,Amazing! Great food and great service. Constant refills which is very nice. You get bread and butter in the beginning to snack on and then your food comes out very quickly. The restaurant feels like you have left New York and gone to Italy it is that fancy.,Arno,141 W 38th St
22875,5,69,Italian,5,05/19/2022,Fabulous! The wait staff was very attentive and they were packed. Enjoyed a nice table in the front by the street…. The ambiance was great. Save room for the tiramisu!,Arno,141 W 38th St
22876,6,69,Italian,5,05/19/2020,"I'd give it 10 stars if I could! One of the few traditional fine dining establishments, while still feeling extremely accessible. From the start we were hooked.

Nice starters, good choice of menu and a fairly extensive wine list. Although it was busy I can't imagine they have to turn people away too often as the place is pretty big and airy.",Arno,141 W 38th St
22879,9,69,Italian,1,05/19/2020,"Service very slow and distracted.  Food was just so so, nothing really tasty and appetizing. $25 for 4 shrimps cocktail...  Oh and extra, they'll charge you more if you decide to split the bill... Unbelievable  Won't go back ever",Arno,141 W 38th St
22880,10,69,Italian,5,05/19/2021,Owner was incredibly nice and opened the door for us on the way in and out. Everyone was very hospitable. The food was excellent and the service was just as great. Can't wait to come back here next time I'm in NYC.,Arno,141 W 38th St
22881,11,69,Italian,5,05/20/2019,"The atmosphere was classy but friendly, if you are looking for authentic Italian then here's a place not far from Time Square.

22883,13,69,Italian,2,05/19/2022,We had reservations for 8pm and arrived at 745pm. We were greeted almost immediately and told it would be about 10 minutes. There was a couple in front of us as well as one after. We were sat and asked about drinks. No drink menu was brought but we ordered from the bar. The drinks came pretty quickly. From there it went downhill. We waited another 20 minutes with no acknowledgement as tables around us had orders taken and got food. Tables that came in after us. Still no one came to say it would be just a minute or apologize or anything. We guessed at how much our drinks cost left cash on the table and left. Very sad that after so many good reviews we decided to go there for our anniversary dinner and ended up having to go somewhere else.,Arno,141 W 38th St
22884,14,69,Italian,5,05/19/2022,"Love this place. The customer service is absolutely incredible.

22889,20,69,Italian,4,05/19/2022,"Everyone is so nice and it’s obvious that this place has many regulars. Great if you like traditional Italian food, but I prefer more refined preparation. I had the mixed salad, which was overdressed; the tomatoes were cold and tasted like they were in the fridge for too long. The red snapper was filleted, fried and covered in sauce.  I don’t believe that good ingredients need to be fried or covered in sauce, but this is a matter of preference, so if you like Italian food prepared this way, I’d recommend giving it a try.",Arno,141 W 38th St
22890,21,69,Italian,2,05/19/2022,"The food was delicious as well as the drinks served. Servers are terribly slow and will forget about you if you have a small party, I regret coming here. For the amount of money you pay here I would expect them to run if they see you having an empty drink. I’ve traveled across the world and tried many wonderful Italian restaurants and I can confidently say this is one of the worst in terms of service.",Arno,141 W 38th St
22891,22,69,Italian,5,05/19/2022,"Best Italian restaurant in Manhattan. Food was fresh and perfectly cooked. Service was 5 star, you felt as if you were part of the family. Will definitely return.",Arno,141 W 38th St
22892,24,69,Italian,5,05/19/2022,"Amo is a hidden gem in the middle of midtown. This is one of the few places in New York where you can find classic city ambiance, the most amicable service and Michelin quality food that transports you to the Mediterranean with its flavors. The owner greets you and offers you a kind of warmth that is so welcoming once feels  Like family: it’s a great place to visit and to eat!",Arno,141 W 38th St
22893,25,69,Italian,1,05/19/2022,"Worst restaurant I’ve been to in NY. Waited 10 minutes for food menus. No drink menu. Server handed them to us and walked away. People running all over the restaurant but no customer service or friendliness. The food is over priced and is subpar in quality and portion size. $23 for 4 pieces of shrimp for an appetizer. Tried to order a glass of wine and ask the server where the bathroom was and the server straight up said no and walked away from the table. Food took a long time to arrive. Tried to order the glass of wine again with the person who brought our food and he said to ask someone else, though our waiter was no where to be found. Half the food was luke warm. Our waiter finally showed back up and actually apologized for ignoring us. Do yourself a favor and walk the 5 blocks to the Olive Garden.",Arno,141 W 38th St
22894,26,69,Italian,3,05/19/2022,"Pros: Food is good. Ok pricing. Gluten Free pasta is available.  Cons: not very allergy friendly at all other than gluten free past, but the problem is that the staff didn't seem to want to help answer questions about the various dishes and their allergens, very much a trying to rush through getting orders, get food out. The place was PACKED. Tables are on top of each other. If you want room and are worried about covid at all still you will likely not feel comfortable during the dinner rush.",Arno,141 W 38th St
22895,27,69,Italian,5,05/19/2022,"The food was magnificent. Great service, great drinks great ambience. Staff was very knowledgeable of their wine list and food menu. I would definitely recommend this place for a fine dining experience.",Arno,141 W 38th St

22898,30,69,Italian,5,05/19/2021,The owner is very polite and knowledgeable. The food is unparalleled and should be paired with one of their many options of wines.    Ambiance is key here.

22903,36,69,Italian,5,05/20/2019,"The food was all very good. The waiter was really attentive and funny. This was a great business dinner. I enjoyed everything I tasted. The only negative wasn't even a negative more it was just an observation. The pasta that they warned me was spicy, had little to no heat. I am use to Asian or Mexican flavors when it comes to spicy. If they warn you it's hot, you better be ready, but Italian food usually doesn't go to those levels of heat.",Arno,141 W 38th St
22904,37,69,Italian,5,05/19/2020,"Great food, great service. I got a side of angel hair pasta with the meat sauce and it might have been the best part of the meal.    The calamari appetizer was fresh, definitely not frozen. And the staff was especially attentive.",Arno,141 W 38th St
22905,38,69,Italian,5,05/19/2020,"We were a big group (12 people) they had our table ready even when we showed up 30 mins prior to our reservation time. The staff was amazing; gave great recommendations on wine, quickly brought out some appetizers while we were waiting for the other half of our group, joked around with us & made us feel like family. Honestly it was the best time we had and all of us said we would most definitely  be back just for the experience alone. Then we had the food, which was out of this world! A few of us just got back from Italy and could swear we were back there just closing our eyes eating our dinners.",Arno,141 W 38th St

While it was a white table service and treated as such,  the atmosphere was very relaxing.   All meals and desserts were delicious and the highlight of the night was an opera-style rendition of Happy Birthday for our 7 year old daughter.   Highly recommend and will be here again in the future.",Arno,141 W 38th St
22909,43,69,Italian,1,05/20/2019,"Extremely disappointing. although they have plenty of tables in the main  area, they sat us in the bar. We proceeded to order overpriced wine, that was not great. After ordering a steak , it was sent back to the kitchen three more times. We ordered it medium and it came out charcoal burnt the first time, and still moving rare the second . The waiter nor the manager cared enough to look into the problem.  Extremely disappointed in the experience. Would not recommend it and do not care to go back.",Arno,141 W 38th St

Food came out too fast... we had barely started eating the bread... almost wondered how they cooked it, it was so fast. Not the experience we were looking for.",Arno,141 W 38th St
22913,47,69,Italian,3,05/20/2017,"Food was amazing as was the atmosphere.  We came here for a date night as it was highly recommended and have never been to the city before.  We were pretty disappointed in our server however.  We are a ginger couple and felt that was a factor in how much attention we received.  Very inattentive the entire time and restaurant was not busy at the time.  Waited nearly 15 min. For a water refill, we were never asked if we needed anything else during our visit except by the buser.  Once we were finished and once our plates were cleared by other wait staff, We waited another nearly 10-15 minutes before we were acknowledged by our waiter and asked if we would like dessert or anything else.  He often stood in the proximity of our table but with his back to us the entire evening watching his other tables.  Even walking by our table to others he never gave as much as a glance to see if we needed anything or how our dinner was going.",Arno,141 W 38th St

22916,50,69,Italian,3,05/20/2019,"Went to Arno for a work dinner.  Ordered the lemon chicken.  Food was good, but I expected it to come with pasta since its an italian restaurant.   It came with mashed potatoes.   Service was good at first. But once we got our food they didn't  check on us at all.   It took so long for someone to get to us, we didnt get to order dessert.  Personally I think its overpriced for the quality and service.  But not a terrible place.",Arno,141 W 38th St
22917,51,69,Italian,1,05/20/2018,"Please read this entire review.    Let me begin by saying I have never written a negative review on any restaurant in the past. My expectations from a NYC restaurant are high but not unrealistic.    We had a reservation at 8:00 but our table was not ready. No big deal we will have a drink at the bar. The bartender was lovely.  Our table became available and the waiter brought our drinks from the bar to the table. Fine. So far so good.  We sat without a waiter for about 5 minutes. No big deal. After about 10 minutes they brought us a menu. Then approximately 10 more minutes I had to ask for a wine menu.  We sat there with no interaction for another 10 minutes and were quite fed up. We decided this was unacceptable for New York City and decided to leave. We got up and I went to the coat check to retrieve our coats ( the coat check lady was wonderful).  I went back to the bar where my wife was and asked to talk to the manager, Carlos. Carlos was anything but a manager. I could not believe how rude he was initially to my wife and then to me.  I am honestly very cordial and laid back. I would not leave a negative posting if it really doesn’t deserve it. Carlos could not have cared less that we were leaving. I told him the service was terrible and he told us that in 32 years he has never heard this in the past? Seriously? Never in 32 years. There was no attempt to placate us at all. He basically said just leave. We are not high maintenance at all but his attitude was disgraceful for a NYC restaurant. I sincerely hope this restaurant fails as I cannot imagine people will tolerate this horrible service for long.  Unfortunately we didn’t get to taste the food. The way this experience began we were not going to tolerate it. By contrast we had dinner at another restaurant last night but I will not mention it out of respect but you have many other choices in NYC than this place. I hope you choose a better restaurant for your dollars. I wasn’t going to spend mine here.",Arno,141 W 38th St
22918,53,69,Italian,5,05/19/2022,Great food with great service. Servers are personable and can clearly inform any person of anything on the menu and more. 10/10 would recommend to anyone for great Italian food and great wine.,Arno,141 W 38th St
22919,54,69,Italian,3,05/19/2020,"Overall it was meh. Yes place seems very fancy and wait staff is on point, very professionally ran but food was ok. Nothing to go back a 2nd time for. I ordered the delminico steak and was expecting something much much better but it was on par with regular N.Y. sirloin. There was no crazy marbeling as menu described. The mozzarella fried triangles with tomato sauce was not very good. I was expecting fresh mozzarella and sliced tomatoes but when fried triangles of cheese arrived I was willing to try. Frying it did nothing as the exceedingly thick breading on cheese too away from fresh cheese flavor. Overall food was just ok.",Arno,141 W 38th St
22920,55,69,Italian,1,05/19/2020,"Let me be frank -- the 1-star rating has nothing to do with the food (which was spectacular) and EVERYTHING to do with service (which was horrible). We were celebrating my mother's 75th birthday, so we wanted a relaxed dinner. We were shoved into a back corner table. We were given menus, but no wine list. The waiter came over to ask if he could take our orders. When I asked about a wine list, he said he'd bring one but ""did we know what we wanted to eat?"" So we ordered. No one ordered an appetizer, as we were hoping to have a glass of bubbly to toast Mom first. The waiter finally brought over a wine list -- complete with a dirty wine glass -- and our dinners came out not even 5 minutes later. (So much for it being truly prepared ""fresh""... ). STILL no wine. The waiter eventually brought the wine; when the first of us finished our glass, he removed the wine glass, didn't offer to bring the drinks menu back, and basically treated us as though we were just a table he needed to turn over as quickly as possible. Mind you, by this time, it was about 7:45 -- so all the theater patrons had gone and we were one of maybe 6 or 7 tables left. PLENTY of time to provide a bit better service.  Long story short -- if they have take-out, I'd eat there again, but if you're looking for someplace to have a nice, quiet, relaxed meal, go somewhere else.",Arno,141 W 38th St
22921,56,69,Italian,4,05/19/2020,"This is a classic NYC american Italian large portions old school kind of place.  This place has not changed in years and there is no reason it should - sticking to their roots is clearly what has kept them around for so long.  If you have a business meeting over lunch or dinner, this is a great place as your venue... whether it is a 2 person meeting or a 6+ person meeting... you will be in and out as quickly as you would like to be.    Would i come here on a date... probably not... is it an amazing lunch spot for business purposes - absolutely.",Arno,141 W 38th St
22922,57,69,Italian,5,05/20/2019,"My first time eating here, but definitely not the last. The bread was so flavorful and all the food was well prepared and delicious.  The desserts were beautifully presented. A lovely find.",Arno,141 W 38th St
22923,58,69,Italian,5,05/20/2019,"Went there with some friends after a play on a Saturday night. Staff is very friendly and helpful. The pasta is out of this world. We had the gnocchi with pesto sauce to share as a starter. Just WOW. The pasta is so fresh and melts in your mouth. DELISH!!!!!! The halibut with asparagus and artichoke in a lemon sauce was also very good. Instead of a dessert menu, they come around with a cart of desserts that are all picture perfect...and just as tasty. Highly recommend this place, and I’ll defnitely go back",Arno,141 W 38th St
22924,59,69,Italian,5,05/20/2019,"Our waiter John was very good- great service but no recommendation on menu items.  We had angel hair pasta with meat sauce, steak, salmon and wine - all very good. Very satisfied with what we got for the price.",Arno,141 W 38th St
22925,60,69,Italian,5,05/19/2020,"Very delicious, especially the bread! Recommend the baked clams, calamari, and the mussels as appetizers to share. The menu is classic Italian fare with pasta, seafood, and veal featured. When it's time to order dessert, they bring to the table a trolley full of yummy options to choose from!",Arno,141 W 38th St
22926,61,69,Italian,3,05/19/2020,"The food was good and the service not so much.  It was not crowded but the waiter treated us as if we he didn't want us there. He never returned to the table after taking the order. For the prices they charge, you would expect better service.",Arno,141 W 38th St
22927,62,69,Italian,5,05/20/2018,So this is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in all of New York. The food is excellent and the service is even better. Every time I go there I feel like they've been waiting for me to arrive. I've never had a bad meal there!,Arno,141 W 38th St
22928,63,69,Italian,4,05/20/2019,"The food was good. The staff is friendly but inattentive. The tables are cramped together in one part of the restaurant, felt like every time I moved I bumped into the tables next to me. Great wine list.",Arno,141 W 38th St
22929,64,69,Italian,5,05/19/2020,Came home in with 2 kids and had a great time . Excellent fettuccine and Delmonico . Top service. Thanks!,Arno,141 W 38th St

22931,66,69,Italian,4,05/20/2018,Went for business lunch.  Classic Italian menu with some interesting specials.  Excellent service in a comfortable environment.  Food was very good and portion size just right.  They know their regulars well.,Arno,141 W 38th St
22932,67,69,Italian,3,05/19/2020,"Restaurant needs renovation. Just old in general, awful furniture, almost no natural light unless you get one of the  very few tables close to a window.  Food was below average. For apps Clams, calamari and mozzarella di Buffalo. Clams and calamari were terrible. The mozzarella with the tomato awfully presented and nothing special.    For mains the chicken with lemon sauce was very nice, the gnocchi seemed just ok  I would not recommend with so many great options in the city. This place is not worth it.",Arno,141 W 38th St
22933,68,69,Italian,5,05/20/2019,I went to Arno last night for the first time and I was treated like a regular. The food was outstanding and the service was first rate. Carlos and his team made us fell Line we were home. I would highly recommend this restaurant.,Arno,141 W 38th St
22934,69,69,Italian,5,05/20/2018,"Great food menu with attentive staff. Great wine cellar selections. The owner also owns Delmonico's and knows how to pick gourmet chefs for the kitchen, great waiters and staff and everyone looks like they are enjoying a festive dinner. The downstairs room is great for dinner meetings that I've attended quarterly the last four years as well as a few other Dental Continuing Educatiom meetings. That room can accommodate vendor/sponsor tables around the side with dinner tables, a podium with sound system and screen for presention projections.",Arno,141 W 38th St
22935,70,69,Italian,4,05/19/2020,"Arno was just ok, went with 30 people so i didn't see the full menu. But they could have done a bit better. Staff was good, bartender sucked. I would say there plenty of other place to eat at. Overall it was just ok.",Arno,141 W 38th St
22936,71,69,Italian,4,05/19/2020,"The food was incredible, but the portions were tiny. We were actually still hungry after finishing our meal which was surprising for an Italian restaurant. Everyone loved their food, but wish we had more of it.",Arno,141 W 38th St
22937,72,69,Italian,2,05/20/2017,"Interesting. No, disappointing.  Party of 1, and no one follows up to see how my meal was. Not a manager, waiter, etc. And if the only conversation is after my meal ""would you like some coffe?"" That doesn't count. Sadly, too many other dining options. And sad because I heard so many good things about this restaurant. Will not be a good food blog review unfortunately. Good food can be ruined by a poor experience.",Arno,141 W 38th St
22938,73,69,Italian,4,05/20/2019,"Service and attention was excellent. Very family environment, but not family portions...order an appetizer. Food is really, really good....just not great. Still, I would go again because of the great hospitality.",Arno,141 W 38th St
22939,74,69,Italian,1,05/20/2019,"Worst meal I've ever had in NYC, and I live in the area. The worst risotto I've ever had with shrimp and scallops that's are so tiny that you can't find.

22940,75,69,Italian,5,05/20/2019,"A great old school white table cloth Italian restaurant. Everything I’ve had here has been delicious. All of the waiters have accents that are both charming and occasionally hard to understand, which is part of the fun.",Arno,141 W 38th St
22941,76,69,Italian,5,05/19/2020,"Food was delicious!  Service was great, they were so attentative.  Food came out quick.  Atmosphere was nice.  You are going to pay extra, but when the food and service is this good, you don't mind.",Arno,141 W 38th St

22945,80,69,Italian,2,05/21/2014,"The food is mediocre at best, and the entrees are in no way cheap. I suggest going somewhere else.    The ambience is good, and it is patronized by moneyed midtown lunchers. A side of rice will cost you $7.00 and make you wish that you had a 2 slices and a coke somewhere instead.    Would I come back? Sure - as long as I am not paying for the check.",Arno,141 W 38th St
22946,81,69,Italian,5,05/20/2019,I haven’t tried the food yet. I stopped in randomly with my girlfriend for a glass of wine and just loved the place. It has a good energy to it. As soon as I get a chance I’ll be back for dinner.,Arno,141 W 38th St
22947,83,69,Italian,5,05/20/2019,Outstanding Food and Service. We crashed in with a large crowd at the last minute and the team at Arno was able to easily accomodate our requests. The food and ambiance were both outstanding,Arno,141 W 38th St
22948,84,69,Italian,3,05/19/2020,The food was amazing but the wait staff was not. They never came back to check on us and offer dessert. We had to ask for our bill and they were put out by that. Maybe because it was midafternoon but not welcoming.,Arno,141 W 38th St
22949,85,69,Italian,3,05/21/2013,Old man Italian atmosphere. It's sort of a boring place to go. Stopped in once for happy hour and we got a nice table. Place was quiet but we had the bar tender's full attention. That can be a good thing when you've had a stressful day.,Arno,141 W 38th St

22962,100,69,Italian,3,05/20/2017,Great atmosphere but the food quality did not match the price in my opinion. I had their Delmonico's Ribeye steak but it tasted nothing like the signature Ribeye I actually had at Delmonico's. It was less marbled and more charred.,Arno,141 W 38th St

The service chaotic and hectic. A volume like at the train station. Our ordered plain pasta was very disappointing. I hope that's not all New Yorkers think of as an Italian restaurant.    Nevertheless, there are two points because there were very few tourists in the restaurant, many locals. And yet we were treated fairly and equally by the manager and staff. Despite tourists. Many Thanks.",Arno,141 W 38th St

Dinner was beyond delicious everything made fresh the seasoning the flavors perfect. The bread is divine and yes I love great bread. The service was exceptional. The owner Vinny is very hands on and makes you feel at home. Wonderful experience. This is our spot now. 5 plus stars  ,Peppino’s Restaurant,53 NJ-34
23556,1,71,Italian,5,11/20/2022,"We stopped in for dinner, after a long flight from Portland, OR., on our way to the Jersey shore.  4 words - so fresh, so good!  We were happily greeted and brought to a table near the window. We watched as they delivered amazing pizza, after pizza to the surrounding tables. The aroma was on point!  We opted to order the Caprese salad, and bruschetta to start, followed by a Blanca pizza and a cheese calzone to follow.  This place did not disappoint!  Great service, friendly atmosphere, clean setting. All the yummy dinner boxes checked! We’ll be back!",Peppino’s Restaurant,53 NJ-34

23563,8,71,Italian,4,03/20/2023,"Food was fantastic….service was alright to begin.    We went on a busy Saturday night and didn’t get tended to for over 30 mins. Understandable that it was busy but something as basic as water should have been provided.    When we pointed this out, the management responded immediately and incredibly. They comped our apps and assigned us a server right away, and the food was INCREDIBLE.    For apps, we ordered the garlic crisps (by far my favorite) and the fried artichokes. For mains, we got the penne vodka and chicken Milanese - both absolutely incredible…and hefty! For dessert we wanted the tiramisu but they were out so got the chocolate cake instead. Was ok but definitely will be back to try the tiramisu and a pie.    Overall, food was great and experience started not so strong but definitely took a turn for the better. Absolutely do recommend based off the quality of the food alone.",Peppino’s Restaurant,53 NJ-34

23582,27,71,Italian,4,02/18/2023,"updated review upon ownership change. The place has brighted up and is inviting, although with hard floors and no wall coverings does get loud. Our night this pizza place had no dough. so no pizza, tried the entries; they were good but not awesome: my veal was oversalted, my wife's sauce had too much sugar but the shrimp entree was solid. maybe a 3+ or a 4 now. (I think prices went up but isnt that everywhere?)    WOW: The improvement is amazing!! Our dinner was perfect: wonderfully seasoned, more than ample portions, Service was prompt, attentive, professional. Yep: I take back any cautions. The majority of diners were taking home a pizza too so seems we need to go back ASAP to check that out: Amazing transformation!",Peppino’s Restaurant,53 NJ-34

23591,37,71,Italian,3,05/19/2021,"It honestly pains me to leave a bad review for a restaurant, as I work in the service industry and I understand how things can be. But the experience I just had was truly upsetting. I brought my mother their for Mother’s Day. We had reservations still had to wait to be seated and didn’t get our food for another three hours. Knowing how long we waited the staff shrugged shoulders and just said yeah we are busy. No compensation or condolences. Again if we were eating steaks or pork chops I could maybe even see food taking longer, but quite honestly the entire restaurant was sitting there with no food. When the meals came they were staggered and my order wasn’t even right. We all made special plans to be here with my mother today, and this was a huge disappointment and my mother a regular customer deserved better.",Peppino’s Restaurant,53 NJ-34

23596,42,71,Italian,5,05/20/2019,"My family (party of 11) came here for Mother's Day lunch. I didn't know what to expect, and I think a lot of people would pass right by here on Route 34 without even noticing the place. My advice to you: don't do that. Head on in for some fantastic Italian.    From the second we walked in, everyone was extremely welcoming and friendly. Our server Gina was probably one of the best I've ever had. I started with the Fried Calamari - large, tender breaded rings that hit the spot. It was well seasoned, not over-fried, and didn't have too much breading. For my main, I got the Chicken Abruzzi, which combined some of my favorite foods all into one dish. Chicken breast topped with eggplant, prosciutto, and mozzarella served in a brown sherry wine sauce with wild mushrooms. All flavors came together to make a fantastic entree. All of the pieces of the dish were cooked perfectly, and it really hit the spot. Large portions all around as well.    While I didn't try other entrees, I don't think there was one person that didn't enjoy their meal, and that was a party of 11 as I said. We topped it off with some of their fantastic desserts and left feeling full and happy.    Overall, this place is truly fantastic. BYOB is certainly an added bonus. My verdict: highly recommend - no matter what you order, you'll have a great meal. It's tough for me to give a full 5 stars, but they deserve it.",Peppino’s Restaurant,53 NJ-34

We both split a stuffed mushroom with sausage appetizer.  My husband had the mussels and linguini while I had the Veal Florencia without the peppers. My husband mentioned that one of the mussels had sand but all the others were ok. Both entrees come with a salad but my salad had the ends of the lettuce which was not too appetizing.  The meal itself was very good and enjoyable.  By the time the dessert tray was brought out, I was so full from the meal that I could not partake but they did look very appealing.    Would definitely return and recommend this restaurant.",Peppino’s Restaurant,53 NJ-34

23724,175,71,Italian,5,05/12/2023,Wow. Blown away. Real Brooklyn bread and real Italian food in Holmdel area - finally. This is by far the best Italian restaurant in the area for lunch or dinner. I guess it is a family with restaurants in Brooklyn who brought it here? I accidentally called the Brooklyn location at first. They transferred me to Nj. Food is absolutely outstanding. I can’t emphasize enough how good this food is.,Peppino’s Restaurant,53 NJ-34

42484,152,161,Italian,1,05/26/2022,"Horrible experience! I ordered salad, soup and breadsticks, along with tiramisu for dessert. I received two olives with a large container of lettuce. I was told by the waitress that for take out you only get two olives and two tomatoes. What a ridiculous policy! What difference does it make if I sit down or order out? The prices are the same, the quantity is the same and the tip is the same.  I would think that the Olive Garden would want to give their customers an even better take out experience to encourage them to possibly come inside.  Instead you are punishing your take out customers with poor policies and limitations on Olives and tomatoes.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,610 Sunrise Hwy
25526,0,81,Italian,5,05/19/2022,"I really like it, when a restaurant accommodates my requests and goes beyond the printed menu. I believe this is one of the factors that make the restaurant stand out from others.    At Paola's, I asked for a cheese plate. It's what I wanted for my lunch with desserts and coffee. Although the cheese plate is not on the menu, the server was open and gracious, and the kitchen was able to present a pretty dish, with honey that had truffles in it.    I totally enjoyed my food, the lively background music, and the efficiency of the servers.    Highly Recommended!",Paola's,1361 Lexington Ave
25527,1,81,Italian,5,05/19/2021,"Paola’s is a fabulous upscale restaurant that recently relocated from Madison Avenue to Lexington Avenue. Let me break down our most recent meal. We started off with the warm mozzarella which is hands down the best in the city. The portion is a bit small but the taste makes up for it. We also started with the Arugula Salad which is always very good. For main courses we ordered the salmon, branzino, the veal and the pesto which we got to share. Both fish dishes were a relatively big portion and were very tasty. The veal was small but tasted really great and so did the potatoes that came along with it. Finally, the pesto was a pretty small portion, but very good. For dessert, the cappuccino was just the right size however it could have been a little warmer. We also got the tiramisu which was so so good. Finally the biscottis were just the right thing to top off the fabulous meal. Overall a great experience. 5 stars.",Paola's,1361 Lexington Ave

I consider that there is deception because it has nothing more to do with it. do not rely on the photos to make your choice.

25544,19,81,Italian,1,05/19/2022,"Terrible ambience, extremely poorly managed and do not honor reservations (which is as basic of a restaurant feature in NYC as you can get!) I do not understand how this place has 4.5 starts (probably inflated through other means?). We went there with a confirmed RESERVATION  and they said we couldn’t get a table for over an hour and a half, and they didn’t even apologize or offer any way to compensate this bad experience. We waited for a little bit but it was clear that the place was a mess. I’m so sorry to leave such a mean review but it is so warranted.",Paola's,1361 Lexington Ave

25551,26,81,Italian,2,05/19/2020,"Food was good! But whatever you do, DON'T ask if they have any white wines on the sweeter end.

25552,27,81,Italian,5,05/20/2019,"Arguably some of the best pastas in the city, staff wonderful and fish dishes are great too. good meat specials when they have (Venison, Lamb,Pork). Meatballs and sides are all great-make sure to try barlotti beans. Downside would be sometimes the food is over salted and you feel rushed . Prices are a bit steep but worth it.",Paola's,1361 Lexington Ave
25553,28,81,Italian,1,05/20/2018,These positive reviews must have been paid for or solicited by the restaurant. This is not a restaurant for 2 or 4 adults to have a fine Italian dinner. A group of 8 or 10 friends for a night out perhaps. A place to go with your small children perhaps.  We had the worst possible experience at Paola's. The noise level was so extreme you could not have a conversation. Their were small children eating from their squeeze packs. The seating was tight. The food was mediocre at best.

25562,37,81,Italian,1,05/20/2019,Really Bad Service. Food is below standards for a place on Madison Ave. the Mozzarella Cheese wasn’t fresh at all. The waiter brought me a wrong wine (different from what I ordered) and up charged me for it. We asked for a Desert menu from 3  guys and yet after 10 minutes no one came with it. Walked Out.

The food was really good. I especially liked the pasta special, home made spaghetti with pepper - pasta really good and perfectly seasoned. I really like the fact that you can get half orders of all the pastas. My husband had Gamberi alla Griglia, Grilled Jumbo Shrimp with Grilled Corn Salad and Arugala, which was wonderful and quite light. My friend had the Jewish Roman artichokes which she said were delicious.All three of us would recommend this restaurant and consider it a ""Do-Over"",",Paola's,1361 Lexington Ave

We arrived on a warm Sunday without a reservation but we're able to be seated at the bar, got some smart wine recommendations from the bartender and had a delightful pasta lunch - the pappardella with rich wild boar ragu and a very competent cacio e pepe, simple but executed perfectly, and finished with a piece of their ricotta cheese cake.   Not overly sweet like the Americanized version but much closer to what I've often had in Rome.    Recommended - but reservations are a good idea!",Paola's,1361 Lexington Ave

25574,49,81,Italian,4,05/21/2014,"I recently visited Paola's Restaurant for lunch as part of Italian Dine Out, where there was a fixed 3 course lunch special for $26.  As I approached 92nd Ave and Madison, I started to second guess myself.  Was I dressed appropriately? Will they mind that my reservation changed from 2 people to lone little me?  Is this one of those she-she, nose in the air, kind of spots or would it be less stuffy?    My first positive sign, young families with kids.  Whew!  If the restaurant can tolerate crying kids and kid size messes then I'm a drop in the bucket.  It was a Sunday afternoon when I checked into the restaurant and things were quiet and sparsely populated inside so I opted for outdoor seating.  I was provided with the Italian Dine Out Fixed Prix menu and selected my 3 courses.    For starters, I had the artichokes, secundi was lemon asparagus spaghetti and for dessert, lemon tart.  My favorites were the spaghetti and torte.  The food was amazing, the pasta fresh yet light and the torte was a perfect ending to it all!   One minor complaint was that the service slowed after dessert.  I had a bit of a wait for the check.  In their defense, they may have noticed me on my IPAD and not wanting to interrupt, gave me time to enjoy myself.  Who knows?",Paola's,1361 Lexington Ave

25584,59,81,Italian,2,05/21/2014,"We have been coming to what is now called ""Paola's"" since it was ""Busby's"" and the food was terrific.  We were away from Busby's for a long time during which it underwent a few changes then re-emerged as ""Paola's"".  We returned last Easter for brunch after church at Heavenly Rest.  The food was dismaying.  The eggs benedict were cool, not hot, the Hollandaise sauce was tasteless, and the French Toast was cold.  The portions were surprisingly small for what they cost.  We ate it anyway without complaint.  This Easter, thinking surely things would have improved, we returned, stupidly, for brunch after church at Heavenly Rest.  The eggs benedict were cool, not hot, the Hollandaise sauce was tasteless, and the French Toast was cold.  In addition, this time my son ordered a pasta dish, and it was cold.  The portions were surprisingly small for what they cost.  We ate it anyway without complaint -- except this time decided to speak out here and also on Zagat, as well as informing our friends and associates.  Fool me twice, shame on me.  Who's running this kitchen anyway?  How hard can it be to get hot food to the table in such a small restaurant?  How can small diners make tasty Hollandaise that would put this place to shame?  Something is truly amiss at Paola's, and we are not coming back.",Paola's,1361 Lexington Ave

25726,0,82,Italian,5,05/19/2022,Olive Garden is my granddaughters favorite birthday restaurant and we go every year for her birthday and for several other occasions as well. The decor and ambiance is so nice and family style plus the food is absolutely delicious!  I especially love the taste of the marinara sauce it's so different than an average Italian restaurant I could drink it like it's a soup!   The employees are very nice and kind and easy to talk with.  As I said the feeling of having lunch or dinner there is very homey and comfortable and the decorations and fireplaces makes it extra warm a cozy to make you come back over and over. 5 Stars!!!,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,323 Mt Hope Ave
25727,1,82,Italian,5,11/20/2022,"Our waiter was great and the food didn't take that long to come out. There was no wait time to get seated . We ordered soup and salad which was delicious along with the Chicken Parm. I also had cappuccino which was really amazing  .  It’s always consistently good and the waiting staff is friendly… it’s at a busy location so this time we were lucky, sometimes they tell you there is a wait time but it’s never extremely long… more like 35 mins I come here maybe twice a month. Salad is great pasta is great and the appetizers are excellent so I definitely recommend this one over the next closest one.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,323 Mt Hope Ave
25728,2,82,Italian,1,04/19/2023,Bad service took a long time to greet and serve drink no refill. Food presentation very poor no cheese was offered on salad and soup. The restaurant was nearly empty so there's no excuse for poor service.  Drink no orange or cherry. Even bar tender drink presentation was very poor. I'm paying for the experience don't mind tipping good but this server didn't deserve a tip honestly.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,323 Mt Hope Ave

25731,5,82,Italian,2,01/19/2023,"Went there on a Tuesday at 7pm. Got a table near the bar. That was the mistake.  The server was the bartender. She had to tend to the bar, do service bar + serve 5 tables. This is just too much for one person. I blame management.  Because of this our experience was lacking. The server tried her best, she was hustling, but just could not keep up. I asked for basic things like silverware, lemons, more bread sticks several times and either never got them or had to go get them myself.  There was little attention given to us when refills or anything were needed; again, just because the server had too much to do.  Management needs to do the right thing and not set the employees up to fail; it hurts everyone.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,323 Mt Hope Ave
25732,6,82,Italian,4,03/20/2023,"I am not a huge fan of chains, but this location really does an excellent job at what they do. Let's face it, this is New Jersey and you can get great Italian food in most towns. However, they are very consistent with their food. The salad and bread sticks are great. The service is almost always exceptional. Whatever training program their management use it is undoubtedly effective. And it isn't only the waiters/ waitresses, but includes the hostesses, busers, etc.  As a parent they also are a great place to bring children. It can be difficult to find restaurants to take kids that won't be a challenge. Here the food is kid friendly, the staff make a clear effort to make it fun for kids, and they have video games on the tables. This makes it a pretty stress free meal, which really does move the needle when choosing where to eat.  Bottom line is they maximize their format and consistently give you a great experience and value for the money.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,323 Mt Hope Ave
25733,7,82,Italian,4,04/19/2023,"Ate with the larger family tonight, 15 of us. Only took a few minutes for them to ready the table, service was great, even with one waitress taking care of us. Everything was brought out as ordered and in good time. Food is as expected for a chain restaurant, pretty straight forward.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,323 Mt Hope Ave
25734,8,82,Italian,2,02/18/2023,"Been visiting this location once a month but the latest was a disappointment.   Ordered 4 pasta.  2 of the pasta was overcooked so they are too soft and soaked with too much sauce to eat.  Ordered a steak with one of the pasta medium and it came out over cooked.  These aren't enough to just stop as the server was nice, service was fast and OG is our kids' favorite for some reason unknown.    The reason we will go to somewhere else at least for now is the current manager's policy for birthday desert is that you need a coupon to waive it and I don't ever recall having to present one for one of the kids as it makes no sense for kids to sign up for their eclub.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,323 Mt Hope Ave
25735,10,82,Italian,5,05/19/2021,"I am absolutely impressed with how you do things. We, my family and I, always liked Olive Garden, had great experience there, great meals, but in the times like this, during a world wide quarantine, your company truly delivered. First, the young man who came, we got a call first, as instructed, then asked me where to leave the food, since I was outside to enjoy a beautiful day and asked him to just put it and step away, for my safety and his. He was professional and pleasant. Then, when I took the food in, I was amazed how smart the food was packaged. I have had other deliveries since the quarantine started,but here, they actually put items that have to go straight into the fridge into a separate bag, not just because some were cold or hot, but because those would need to be refrigerated for later use and were marked as such, with labels on each box to state what that item was. Amazing, just purely amazing experience and you can be sure, this is the company we will support as we have before, now and for future considerations when it comes to our meals. Thank you Olive Garden and the staff.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,323 Mt Hope Ave
25736,11,82,Italian,5,02/18/2023,"Honestly, I never thought I'd set foot in an Olive Garden. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and taste of the food. Is it gourmet? Nah. But it's very good. I had the taste of Italy and the fried shrimp appetizer. I very much liked the shrimp app. My bf got the tortellini which was also very nice.  Amaretto sours were tasty as well but not a strong drink if that's what you're looking for.  I'd go again.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,323 Mt Hope Ave
25737,12,82,Italian,1,03/20/2023,So disappointed tonight. Went to Olive Garden as we have many times and they made a party of 30 tables right behind us. About 15 teens and their parents. And the volume was absolutely out of control (parents too) Not one waiter asked them to lower their voice- nor did the parents. I understand they are excited but there is a time and a place. Other guests were staring and you can tell they were annoyed. They were screaming with excitement which scared my 3 year old and she started crying. So we packed up our food and finished in the car. How sad. Food was good as always but I’m very disappointed.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,323 Mt Hope Ave
25738,13,82,Italian,5,09/21/2022,"Olive Garden is one of those places that I find myself at every once in a while. But this time the service was absolutely amazing!!

Staff is attentive and the place is clean  Food is good, some new plates are really good which is nice that they try to improve with new seasonal dishes like the pasta nachos.  I love the salad and soups, but unfortunately this time the gnocchi soup was missing some flavor",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,323 Mt Hope Ave
25742,17,82,Italian,5,05/19/2020,"Judging by some of the reviews, this can be hit or miss. I can say that it was a hit for us. The service and food was excellent. Pasta was exactly how I like it, the meat sauce was tasty and Meatballs were great. Always love when you get a drink refill without having to ask for it. I am usually not a chain restaurant fan, but this place came through with flying colors. I will definitely go back again soon. Great Job Olive Garden Rockaway.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,323 Mt Hope Ave
25743,18,82,Italian,1,03/20/2023,"Horrible experience at this location. My husband and I had Olive Garden for our 1st date 15 years ago and every year we choose Olive Garden for anniversary but this sucked. We were seated by a fireplace and nearly roasted, the place wasn’t full but they forgot about us. 30 mins passed and a waitress I think her name was Gia came and asked if anyone came to us, we said no and asked her to move us so she did. Then she asked us if we wanted out drinks by that time we were ready to order food but she took our drink order and walked away. I was like what the hell. She came back with the peach iced tea that tasted like water smh. Took our order! Came back with salad and bread and asked if we wanted cheese. Took 15 mins to get cheese and kept forgetting us. Oh no wine sample at all (1st time this happened) Now to the food, lasagna fritters tasted old. Seafood Alfredo was ok and my husbands chicken and shrimp carbonara was cold. On the way out we realized why servers weren’t working, busy taking selfies. Overall Bad experience",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,323 Mt Hope Ave

Manager tried to charge me for a plate of salad that I never received. my friend gave me from her salad bowl that came with soup.

Bar staff was polite, friendly and efficient.  Unlimited soup or salad and breadsticks to start. Food quality and quantity is good for the price paid. That is especially true for the extra entrees that are available for take out when you leave.  Not what most would consider fine dining, but good food for a reasonable price. Good casual family dining.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,323 Mt Hope Ave
25792,68,82,Italian,3,06/23/2022,"I understand the reduced menu to cut costs, but it's all basically just pasta and thawed low quality chicken tossed in over-salted sauces that all taste the same  these days at the ""authentic Italian"" chain restaurant.   My kids like it... It's the only reason I go these days.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,323 Mt Hope Ave
25793,69,82,Italian,5,05/19/2021,"Had a great time! My partner and I stumbled upon the place during a car trip and decided to stop by and eat here. The restaurant was very well kept and the staff members were phenomenal. Our waiter, Audrey, was particularly great and was hospitable to us the whole time. Her and the other workers there made the entire time enjoyable. Apart from that, the food was delicious. Overall, we had a memorable time here!",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,323 Mt Hope Ave
25794,70,82,Italian,2,05/19/2022,Very disappointed in this restaurant’s food. They did something to the breadsticks that left a nasty aftertaste. The shrimp scampi lacked garlic if it had any. This was a great place to go in the past but unfortunately we will not be returning.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,323 Mt Hope Ave
25795,71,82,Italian,1,12/20/2022,The restaurant needs a serious refreshing. The creamy gnocchi soup was very watery.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,323 Mt Hope Ave

25797,73,82,Italian,5,05/19/2022,Great food. The salad was surprisingly very fresh! Our server Andrew went above and beyond and was very attentive. He knew the menu even though he told us it was only his first day serving.. The rest of the staff were also very accommodating considering the dinner rush. Will be returning!,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,323 Mt Hope Ave
25798,74,82,Italian,4,05/19/2022,It started out as a bad experience first by the hostess seating another party whom stated that they were us. So we had to wait for another 17 minutes for them to figure out why it stated my party was seated while we were still waiting in the waiting area. Instead of being offered an incentive for the ordeal we were offered a table by the bar. We refused of course the audacity of that. At that point I was on the phone with another restaurant making reservations and then the rest of my party decided they wanted to take a chance as to how the service would be and the experience was impeccable.  Theresa was on point. Made great suggestions.  Funny and interactive. She definitely provided great customer service and valued us. Very attentive. If we didn't have Theresa as our server. This review would definitely not end like this. Thank you Theresa for your service we appreciate you.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,323 Mt Hope Ave
25799,75,82,Italian,3,05/19/2022,This food is okay at best. It shouldn't be that much money It's not worth it. Whoever gave this 2 dollar signs to show the affordability of the place is mentally disturbed. I had better Italian food. I don't think you could call the Olive garden Italian.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,323 Mt Hope Ave
25800,76,82,Italian,3,05/19/2022,It's an olive garden so you should expect consistency. Nothing will blow you away. Just some average corporate Italian fare.    Service is spotty. We waited 15min to get a server to look our way only to find that her shift ended and we were abonded without so much as an acknowledgement or goodbye after we were served our meals,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,323 Mt Hope Ave

25803,79,82,Italian,1,05/19/2022,"The employees are awesome and work hard and give great customer service. The food is not italian. The meatball, I couldn't tell you what meat it is. And whatever meat it is it is tasteless and has an almost boiled taste to it. It weird. The sausages are the same one diners have. There is literally no flavor to it. The best thing here is there soups. But there is no love in their food at all and just so bland. Hadn't been in here in years and went for the soup and just left reminded why I don't come. It's disappointing the food they serve on a plate because if even one executive had a true italian mother or grandmother, they know what they would say about this food and what it means that they are trying to represent the italian heritage.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,323 Mt Hope Ave
25804,80,82,Italian,2,05/19/2022,"The waitress could not give me the time of day. I was by myself and she seemed annoyed by that.

She anwered our questions and we ordered our food. The food was amazing, the service was quick. I absolutely love the breadsticks.

Next waitress was okay; but when I asked for a 2nd small salad, she said white lettuce is mixed in. I asked for as much green lettuce as possible & she balked. She brought a large salad (not small) with mostly white lettuce. Lastly, I asked for part of dinner in a to go box plus bill. I waited over 15 min. & she had not come. I passed her as I headed to mgr. desk & asked how come it took her so long to bring bill, etc. She said she took care of other customers. I said when someone is done dining, your responsibility is to bring bill before assisting other customers. I gave her my card asking her to bring me the bill. Instead she runs it thru the kiosk.  I stopped at Mgr. desk on way out & explained I was upset, but Mgr.  brushed it off.  I have been a customer for over 20 yrs.  My respect for Olive Garden has taken a dive is all I can say.

Service was excellent, the food was good, we enjoyed the overall experience. My only issue was in ordering a side of meatballs, this restaurant only allowed two meatballs where as my Olive Garden offered three. I thought that was odd that it was not consistent with other Olive Gardens. Other than that, the food is pretty much consistent, and I like that you can depend on it when you go there. One of my favorite take homes is the five cheese marinara with meatballs. I make three meals out of it for lunches.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,323 Mt Hope Ave

It was just the right amount of questioning and I can try that we had drinks then we need a refill of this that we need more bread more salad. The food came out very quickly hot and fresh. It was easy to tell that had not been sitting on her heat lamp waiting to be brought to the tables.

25873,150,82,Italian,3,05/20/2018,This Olive Garden has their act together in terms of service and bar staff.  The only drawback here is the long wait times which being near a mall causes peak meal time delays.  But they do their best to get the crowds moved through as quickly as possible.  Have always had good and pleasant servers at this location.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,323 Mt Hope Ave
25874,151,82,Italian,2,05/20/2017,"Don't get me wrong, the food is good, but options are limited for vegetarians. The salad policy is nonsense, we ordered 3 main dishes and 2 appetizers and got a bowl of salad filled up only halfway! For four people, the salad quantity is below quantity. Also an extra 3.99  for a refill on your salad is a lot, it should  free since we ordered 3 entrees!  Another point is the waiters who work there. This establishment holds some extremely amazing waiters, but the one we got this time was not really helping us with our vegetarian choices. We ordered the eggplant and asked what else we could order, she says the custom  Pasta would work so we got with that. We were under the impression that the eggplant doesn't Come with anything else on the dish, but it comes with spaghetti; the same custom pasta with same sauce we ordered as a third entree! The waiter did not inform us about this, so we were stuck with three separate but completely similar dishes or pasta!  This ruined our Appetite as well as our decision of returning to dine at Olive Garden!",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,323 Mt Hope Ave

Granted some true Italians may not approve of some of the dishes that they serve at the Olive Garden.  After all mr. Jay Leno will tell you any time that this is not true Italian food.

The restaurant was not that busy and the serve that we had rushed us into ordering food and did not show up for 20 mins. I ordered salad and my husband ordered soup with bread sticks and the main course. The bread sticks came with the main course and another server came to serve our dinner when I mentioned that there were no bread Sticks he got them right away and for the whole dinner we did not see our server. Our waters were empty and we wanted the cheque. The staff should be trained a little better as I have never seen this kind of service at any Olive garden. We ended up being there for an hour and a half just waiting around. It was really not a pleasant experience.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,323 Mt Hope Ave

The place is comfy and, although it's a chain, the food is much better than many mom and pop type Italian places I have tried. Of course, it is not exactly like mama's, but I have no desire to make an entire tray of lasagna for myself.  Plus, Olive Garden uses more seasonings than mama - sausage and slightly stronger herbs - which I like (and she didn't), so overall it's a win. PS. LOVE the zuppa Toscano.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,323 Mt Hope Ave

25911,188,82,Italian,2,05/20/2018,Very unimpressed. I went with my gluten intolerant daughter. We told the waiter several times she was gluten intolerant. She requested the grilled chicken parmesan with gluten free pasta. He brought her chicken with bread crumbs on top. Really? Was no one paying attention? Don't offer dishes for gluten sensitive people if your staff hasn't got a clue. Neither the chef or waiter questioned breadcrumbs with gluten free pasta? She actually are some before realizing she was being glutenized. Never returning.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,323 Mt Hope Ave
25912,189,82,Italian,1,05/20/2019,"They don't even deserve one star. I went here for dinner last night with my sister. I went in at 10:30 to ask if we could still be seated since I read they closed at 11. The hostess said that they could still seat us so we sat for dinner. We were soon met by a harsh reality that all this Olive Garden truly cared about was having us about by 11. The waiter came to our table, and asked for our orders. My sister, and I were still deciding on what we wanted exactly so the waiter came back. He told us that the kitchen was closing so we would need to hurry, and pick. So we told him what we wanted then he arrived back with our breadsticks. He told us that they were not making new breadsticks for us, and gave us a basket with two of the hardest breadsticks we've ever received in our entire lives. They were not edible, and I told him that we were not going to eat them. He then said, I did not think you were going to. Which meant even though they were brought out to us they already knew we weren't going to eat them. After he left we were waiting for our salads which also never arrived at our table, but we were supposed to get with our meals. Then finally our food was brought to us which we asked for to go boxes, because we felt so rudely treated as customers here. We put our food in the boxes, and had already picked a dessert earlier which we had hoped to try. Instead our waiter arrived back in one minute after giving us our to go boxes with the check. I'm sure he was assuming we wanted nothing more, but they should have never told us they would sit us if they were going to treat customers like that. We are so disappointed in our experience at Olive Garden, and definitely would not recommend this place to anyone we know.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,323 Mt Hope Ave

I only do so because it's quiet and buffalo wild wings gets crowded.  I always sit at the bar.  The service is average at best, except for this one guy.  He actually knows how to work.  To make things worst they have this pair of bartenders who work together who are obnoxious.  One of them sings and hums out loud, and has a horrible voice to boot.  He does so randomly too.  Neither have much of a sense of urgency, which is necessary for this business (I've been in it 15 years, 5 of them bartending at an Olive Garden).

The pasta is often over cooked as it was that last time I went.  As for their bread sticks, no one who appreciates Italian bread would find them acceptable.    The only reason I went there is that was where the group was going.  Never a place I would choose as long as there are other options available.

25930,207,82,Italian,3,05/19/2020,"Went here with a family member who really likes this particular location. I'm personally not much for chain restaurants and my experience here proves why.    The overall presentation was nice - the restaurant was clean and pleasant, with a Tuscan-inspired decor like all the other Olive Gardens. every dish was plated well and looked appetizing. The flavors were all strong and erred on the salty side, and nearly everything seemed to have a creamy alfredo component. Too bad if you have issues with, or want to limit, dairy.    Still, the breadsticks were as expected - fluffy, pale rods slicked with garlic and oil. I can see the pedestrian appeal, but found them bereft of any soul. The salad was adequate but filled with iceberg lettuce and limited to one black olive per person at the table. Do they count these things?    An Italian Nacho appetizer was the definition of sinfully good, satisfying every salty and fatty desire I had. The lasagna was flavorful but really a morass of ingredients and not in the cake-like layers as expected. The Chicken Parmesan, while tasty, didn't appear to be made of actual chicken breasts but cutlet shaped patties as I found a few air pockets while cutting through the meat. The most expensive, and most disappointing dish, were the new Zoodles dish made with squash noodles. It lacked other veggies listed in the description, had little chicken and was reduced to watery mush upon taking home.    I'm kinda bummed the meal wasn't better since I actually like other restaurants owned by the same group like Seasons 52 and Longhorn Steakhouse. I guess in a region filled with Italian/Italian-American restaurants of all price ranges, Olive Garden has an uphill battle in trying to satisfy me.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,323 Mt Hope Ave

25945,223,82,Italian,1,05/20/2017,"Perhaps the worse Olive Garden that I've been to anywhere in the nation (I travel a great deal for work and the Soup, Salad & Breadstick combo is usually good, quick and cheap).  Service was terribly slow - 30 mins in between request for a second bowl of soup and actually having it brought to the table.  Same with drink refill and don't even get me started on breadsticks...sigh.  Keep driving, pass it up...it's just not worth it.  Won't be returning (despite a monthly commute past in and out of NYC to PA)",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,323 Mt Hope Ave
25946,224,82,Italian,1,05/20/2019,"My boyfriend and I went to Olive Garden in Rockaway yesterday and we usually go there and have a great time because the waiters are so friendly and helpful, this was NOT the case this time. We were seated and our waiter Chandler was rude to us from the start and waited 10 minutes to help us order our food, even though he was helping the surrounding tables, but completely ignored us. The theme of rudeness continued from our waiter Chandler with snarky replies and at the end of the night THREW our chocolates at us before we left. We could both hear that he was treating the surrounding white families around us with respect, and was kind and helpful, but us, who are both Spanish, with rudeness and disrespect. Although we tried to give our waiter Chandler the benefit of the doubt of possibly having a stressful night resulting in his rudeness, we quickly changed our minds upon hearing how he treated the other caucasian families. We payed on the little black computers on the table and did the survey of how our night was and left upset and confused as to why we were treated that way and can only conclude that Chandler was possibly racist. We considered leaving in the middle of our dinner because it was that big of an issue and we both consider not coming back to the Rockaway Olive Garden.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,323 Mt Hope Ave
25947,225,82,Italian,3,05/20/2019,"Ambiance was nice, the food was mediocre at best. Their eggplant parmigiana was awful.  Certainly not the one mama made. The salad was the best part of the meal.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,323 Mt Hope Ave

I decided to order for delivery to see if the food was just as good as I remember. I ordered Pasta Tremezzo and French fries. You can choose which pasta you want, I chose linguini. The pasta was delicious and cooked perfectly. The French fries were crispy and chunky. They were generous with the portions. I'm definitely going to order from this place again and try different items off their extensive menu.",Vesuvio Restaurant & Pizzeria,7305 3rd Ave

No oil was used, or basil leaves.  These are the ingredients you would find in other pizzerias that serve Grandma Pizza.",Vesuvio Restaurant & Pizzeria,7305 3rd Ave
25973,11,83,Italian,4,12/20/2022,This place is solid. It’s not the best Italian food of your life but it is yummy. I really like the chicken parm here but wasn’t of fan of the Alfredo pasta.

Manicotti was all mozzarella no ricotta cheese and not the right pasta it was sloppy. The calamari was soggy and no flavor and barely any breading. Sad I was expecting so more from such a fancy place.  I'm sorry to say this but this was my experience and pictures don't lie.",Vesuvio Restaurant & Pizzeria,7305 3rd Ave

25977,15,83,Italian,3,03/20/2023,"The food and atmosphere are great and I dont mind paying the increased food prices. However, $5.75 each for a snapple and a convenience fee to use a credit card is simply greed in my opinion. This is a neighhorhood restaurant in Bay ridge. Not the upper east side. Too me this is simply exploitation. To be fair, this is becoming standard practice everywhere. Eating out will be an infrequent occurrence.",Vesuvio Restaurant & Pizzeria,7305 3rd Ave
25978,16,83,Italian,3,05/19/2020,"Got there for a friend’s birthday celebration. The food is average and fair price. We ordered cold antipasto, fried calamari, buffalo wings, and seafood salad. Fried calamari was great and so do cold antipasto; buffalo wings were bit on the sweet side and seafood salad was ok. Spaghetti with white clams sauce was below average so did the pasta Bolognese,  melanzana and veal parmigiana were ok. Warm chocolate cake and tiramisu were fine.",Vesuvio Restaurant & Pizzeria,7305 3rd Ave

It took more than an hour for our food to come out ,however, the table of two next to us who got much more food got their food right way and the waiter was very attentive with them (our same waiter). When our food did come, the chicken was cold, rubbery and bland for all our plates. Our waiter was rude and never checked back on us or asked if we needed anything. Save your money and go to any other Italian Restaurant in the area. Don't waste your money here. Horrible service and even worse food. Sewer water taste better than this place.",Vesuvio Restaurant & Pizzeria,7305 3rd Ave
25981,19,83,Italian,5,05/19/2022,"The restaurant is nicely organized and your not close to other tables where you can have a conversation.  The Italian dishes are prepared the way you like to your satisfaction.  We ordered appetizers and drinks which came out together which was nice as we ordered some spicy (hot) sauce red peppers.  We ordered fish with pasta which was preparedness perfectly.  The wine selection is nice but we both went for cocktails.  The waiter and server couldn't be any nicer. The bread was hot and fresh, not reheated.  Oh BTW the place started out years ago as a Pizzeria and expanded years later and kept that loving family atmosphere as when you walk in is the seating for the Pizzeria and to both sides is the dining areas and the party room is nice for functions and great service and food.  Also would like to say the greetings when you walk in is always friendly and they treat more than a customer they treat you like family.  Compliments to owners as this is a fun place to eat even with children that are kept busy with supplies from staff.  Will be back soon.

25983,21,83,Italian,2,05/20/2019,I haven’t been here in like ten years. The quality of the food is just not what it used to be. I was wowed year ago by their super fresh calamari that was cut fresh. The service was still ok. But the food came out slow even though it was just a Thursday night. The bread was good. But the calamari was very ordinary. You can tell it is the frozen stuff that you get in a large bag. The clam pasta was wayyy to salty. The shrimp pasta’s shrimp was not fresh. It tasted like it was in the bottom of the freezer for god knows how long. Probably wouldn’t come back.,Vesuvio Restaurant & Pizzeria,7305 3rd Ave

25994,32,83,Italian,3,01/19/2023,Really nothing special. Moderately overpriced for extremely moderate food. Rice balls were always cold and just tasted funny. Slides were okay but extremely oily.

25996,34,83,Italian,1,03/20/2023,"Ordered delivery. Maybe on Tuesday afternoon the B team is on in the kitchen. Nothing was seasoned, and was frankly gross. Calimari was tasteless and of course since they were half an hour late was rubbery, the eggplant rollatini was likewise bland and the sauce was clearly not fresh, the pasta faggiol soup tasted like they just put macaroni noodles together with a can of white beans, super gross. They would benefit from the purchase of some fresh garlic and some salt or use them, sorry Vesuvio was hoping for better",Vesuvio Restaurant & Pizzeria,7305 3rd Ave

There is a gentleman who I presume has a managerial position or is perhaps the owner and he is an absolute delight and personally greets everyone and asks how they are doing. Good old hospitality, that wins me over everytime.",Vesuvio Restaurant & Pizzeria,7305 3rd Ave
26027,66,83,Italian,5,05/20/2017,"I understimated this place. A bit pricey, but i must say, it is incredible. By far the best pizza i've had in my life... no joke! They have a Caramelccino, which is a must have. We also tried their ""Hot antipasto"" which is Baked clams, eggplant rollatini, stuffed peppers and stuffed mushrooms in tomato sauce. This chef knows what he is doing, which he also came out to greet us for some weird reason lol but omg, seriously going back. Definitely recommend this place to anyone, they also have a variety of Vegetarian plates for those who dont eat meat. And the service, i must admit was very pleasent! One thing i wasnt to happy with was the waiting time to get our food, then again we went during Lunch so expect to wait longer than usual.",Vesuvio Restaurant & Pizzeria,7305 3rd Ave

I feel bad they they had to do outside service for almost a year due to pandemic, as I love their indoor atmosphere, so soothing and relaxing. They're now indoors again and I'm so happy they've survived the tough times. The food is always amazing, especially love their teramisu desert cake. Went again there recently and was so happy! So hope your restaurant stays in business for many more years to come, definitely one of the best in Bay Ridge.",Vesuvio Restaurant & Pizzeria,7305 3rd Ave

Seamless called the restaurant at 6:53pm and was informed the driver would arrive in 5 minutes at 6:58pm. I then called the restaurant 16 minutes later when the order STILL hasn’t arrived to inquire what is going on. I was informed it would arrive in an additional 5-10 minutes. I told them they already informed seamless 16 minutes ago it was supposed to arrive in 5 minutes. I asked that they call the driver AGAIN and get an ACTUAL eta and not a lie like last time. Driver finally arrives at 7:19pm. This has been a complete waste of time. I’ve ordered from here numerous times over the past few months and today ends my ordering from this place. There are too many BETTER options in Bay Ridge to order from, where they actually care to deliver food on time, or close to it. I’m finished with this place.    YOU’VE BEEN WARNED!!! THE END.

Got back to the hotel and it was cheese pizza. I called to clear up the miss understanding. Thankfully they didn't charge me for the pepperoni. However, his tone of voice and telling me "" what do you want me to do"" was horrible customer service. The management must not understand that time is money.. my time is percious and for the fact I have to spend time to explain what I want him to do to resolve this issue is nonsense.  I would have loved it and been overjoyed if he said he would make another pizza and apologize for the oversight on their end but no they failed to acknowledge that fact.",Vesuvio Restaurant & Pizzeria,7305 3rd Ave

26055,94,83,Italian,1,05/19/2022,"Three of us went to dinner. One dish was inedible, the other two were mediocre at best. Our waiter was amazing, he should get 5 stars. The manager has a very bad attitude and is underhanded. When we complained about the 1 dish he argued with us that it was fine. He asked if the person who had the horrible dish, would they  like a glass of wine. She accepted assuming it was on the house considering we complained about the food and he made it seem that way saying it as a way to make up for the disappointing food . We then found the glass of wine on the bill. He lied to our faces and said there was nothing he could do, only the owner could adjust the bill.",Vesuvio Restaurant & Pizzeria,7305 3rd Ave

We went for lunch and deal with Giuseppe, and booked on the spot. They were so understanding with Covid and accommodating to my requests. Everyone raved about the food, but their wine choices in the package we picked. We were able to connect a phone to their Bluetooth system and play music from Spotify. The staff was unbelievable attentive to all my guests that night. I even left a gift behind and called later that night, they found it and stored it for us until my husband could go back and get it.

I had crispy pan sheet baked garlic bread; a mixed spring salad topped with chopped pistachios, nice chunks of fresh tomatoes, and a creamy ?ricotta cheese, drizzled with a reduced balsamic vinaigrette dressing; pasta primavera (large penne with garlic slices, zucchini, mushrooms, tender carrots and peas in a nicely seasoned sauce); nicely cooked tender chicken; and penne vodka. They also have this white cake which I regret not trying. I will make a point to dine in person at Vesuvio the next chance I get! Good Italian food!!",Vesuvio Restaurant & Pizzeria,7305 3rd Ave

We ordered a half pepperoni and half sausage pizza and picked it up to save time. I was careful how I carried it but when I got it home ....what a mess. The sausage, which did not taste good, was on 3/4 of the pizza and the pepperoni was mostly piled on 2 slices. The dough was soggy from the watery sauce.  We ended up throwing it away and it wasn’t cheap. The chicken roll also looked sloped together. Take pride in the presentation and making the order to the customers request. Won’t go back. It would have been one star but the people are nice.",Vesuvio Restaurant & Pizzeria,7305 3rd Ave

The store still uses foiled containers which could have been one factor and/or the preparation of the chicken/potatoes (how long it was out before being cooked/prepared-my money is on that one) being the other.

The restaurant is nicely decorated with good service and great food. The pizzeria portion is also very good with fast attentive service. They have a special event place in the back where I have been to on several occasions. The service there was excellent and fast. I also want to recommend their delivery service.

The food is always amazing, which can be attributed to them having the same chefs for decades now. The service is always impeccable. They’re more than happy to accommodate almost all requests, and have a small but good wine list (get the Chianti). We’ve been coming here for many years now, and I just wanted to come back and update my review as we were very happy to see that all throughout Covid - nothing changed.

26101,140,83,Italian,4,05/19/2021,"Service was pleasant but slow on a crowded Easter Sunday. Everything was very tasty - chicken rustica, tiramisu, coffee, house chablis, calamari, and lasagna. Unfortunately, the lasagna was totally cold in the middle. It hadn't just lost its heat: rather, it seemed to have been taken out of a fridge or freezer and insufficiently heated. I would go back, but would hope something like that doesn't happen again.",Vesuvio Restaurant & Pizzeria,7305 3rd Ave
26102,141,83,Italian,5,05/20/2018,"The freshest seafood and pasta! Very polite and attentive servers and quite accommodating. Manager even walks around asking patrons about their meals.

26104,143,83,Italian,4,05/20/2019,Fantastic pizza restaurant. Very clean. A welcoming staff. The Vesuvio slice is loaded with toppings. Garlic knots are very garlicky. Would highly recommend stopping in for a slice of you are in the area.,Vesuvio Restaurant & Pizzeria,7305 3rd Ave

26106,145,83,Italian,5,05/20/2019,Brings you back to a bygone era where an Italian Restaurant had decor reminiscent to older Italy. Food was delicious. Wait service was impeccable and the wine temperature was perfect.

26108,147,83,Italian,1,05/20/2019,The pasta dish with shrimp in creamy sauce with peas very disappointing. The peas were either from a can or frozen not fresh. Sauce was gooey. My friends dish had garlic from a jar. Frozen Spinach was used. Salmon okay. Wine awful. Service was slow.Also staff not nice to older people. Crowded. Unpleasant atmosphere. This place is a fire hazard waiting to happen with tables everywhere and difficult paths to get through especially with walkers and wheelchairs.,Vesuvio Restaurant & Pizzeria,7305 3rd Ave
26109,148,83,Italian,2,05/20/2019,65 years old this pizza parlor was one of the best I Bay Ridge. Not anymore. Inconsistent quality with oily Pizza. All the food is basically mediocre. Yet it has a nice space and is generally comfortable. Yet for comfort you can go elsewhere. After my last visit to Vesuvio's I would say that it is ready to retire. Perhaps it did already go to other management. The quality of this restaurant has pretty much gone down drastically over the past year or so.,Vesuvio Restaurant & Pizzeria,7305 3rd Ave
26110,149,83,Italian,3,05/19/2020,"Waited a half hour to be seated followed by slow service. Took at least 10 minutes for someone to ask if we would like drinks, then had to flag them down to ask for bread for the table. 2 out of our party of 4 enjoyed our food.

The food is excellant, the service is outstanding and the prices are on point! I can go on and on about the food, I have not had a bad dish there yet! Pizza is grest also for a quick bite to eat, but the dinners are well worth sitting down to enjoy. The house wine merlot is also great amd does the job for the price. Buy the full craft of it, cheaper than the bottles but on the flip side the bottles are priced well also. The owners and staff make you feel at home if your a 1st time customer or a regular there.

I called back a half hour after and asked to have some type of discount added to my order for having to wait so long, and was placed on the phone with the manager....

I had mild reservations (since for me it was more of a nostalgia trip) which were surprisingly quickly dispelled. We were greeted at the door and promptly seated. My stepfather and I split a bottle of inexpensive yet delicious montepulciano (red) while my mother and wife went for their by-the-glass sauvignon blanc (both ended up ordering another glass). We started with a cold antipasto plate for two and a seafood salad. Both portions were really generous for the price and the quality was top notch - fresh salami, mozzarella dripping in juices and olive oil, delicious seafood. We followed up with a broiled salmon (served with artichokes, roasted potatoes and vegetables) and pasta dishes: carbonara and puttanesca. My mother wouldn't stop complementing the salmon throughout her meal. Milton (our server) was attentive and efficient and we felt well taken care of. Overall, we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and service and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves at Vesuvio.",Vesuvio Restaurant & Pizzeria,7305 3rd Ave

Called back at 8:30 pm and asked what happened to my food and delivery, and was told by a girl that they were waiting on the soup to  come out of the kitchen. What a lame excuse and crock of s***. First and last time for this wanna be dump! Called back at 9:00pm and was told food would be here in 10 minutes. What a disgrace. Anyway after screaming on the phone and demanding my money back, I was told that they will credit back my money and for me to take the food for free, and it was on us. Antonio please do not respond.

26199,0,84,Italian,2,08/22/2022,"Unfortunately, I did not have a good experience here the other night. The atmosphere is very cute and cozy, I loved the ambiance but the food let me down. As soon as we sit, we are given the restaurant week menu which was $60 a person which is fine. But we did not want to order off this menu. There was no alternative menu but the waiter told us we could order things individually and not do the price fixe. That was fine and all until there were no prices to be found for anything. And it was hard to ask for anything because the waiter was very busy and we felt too awkward leaving as we were there for 15+ minutes at this point and my boyfriend already ordered a drink, which was never brought to him and he canceled it altogether, and we got bread.    So we just order anyway. Burrata appetizer was good but very small. It was the size of my palm. I ordered some crusted chicken dish and it was extremely disappointing. For $25, it was a glorified salad. Just a thin, bland piece of chicken cutlet covered in arugula. It wasn't absolutely terrible but I was definitely disappointed. My sister's dish, some pasta with steak pieces, was very delicious and the bread was fabulous too. I would come back because it is such a cute place and their regular menu online looks a lot more appealing than their restaurant week menu but I unfortunately did not have a good experience this time around.",Pastai Restaurant,186 9th Ave
26200,1,84,Italian,4,07/23/2022,"6/28/22 after roaming around for a meal that would satisfy my craving... I chose Pastai, I've eaten here some time ago so I figured why not. I had the bucatini with sardines and a side of sauteed spinach. Both dishes were really good and had great flavors.  The house red (pino) was ok. $13... Kinda steep for house, eh? Lol, but yeah it's the neighborhood. Maybe that's why I was the only one at the bar?  Friendly and fast service.  I'll be back to try other pasta dishes.",Pastai Restaurant,186 9th Ave
26201,2,84,Italian,5,05/19/2022,"i had the paccheri alla genovese per the recommendation of the waiter. the pasta tasted homemade and had great texture. the sauce was flavorful and most importantly balanced. in my opinion there was too little meat and slightly too much onion. still a great dish though and will come back to try other things!    update: came back and tried their lasagna. their tomato sauce was amazing. the meat was a braised beef that was flavorful and had a great texture. all of the cheeses were delicious. most importantly, as stated in my last review, their dishes have a great balance of flavor—the ratio of the ingredients is perfect and nothing is overpowering.",Pastai Restaurant,186 9th Ave
26202,5,84,Italian,5,05/20/2018,A terrific Sicilian restaurant with great tasting food and good wines in nicely curated space.  The service is attentive and very good.  The specials and the pastas are all well prepared and made to order.  There is a back room available for larger parties.  I highly recommend this restaurant for authentic Sicilian food.,Pastai Restaurant,186 9th Ave
26203,6,84,Italian,4,05/19/2020,"Came for a late dinner on Saturday as we wanted some homemade pasta. Searched Google and found this restaurant that's opened till 1am on weekends. Am not disappointed. Their pasta is very tasty, and the sauteed asparagus very flavorful. I ordered the lobster, spinach and fried artichoke tagliatelle and surprised to find many lobster meat in it. I would definitely recommend this hidden gem if you are in the Chelsea area.",Pastai Restaurant,186 9th Ave
26204,7,84,Italian,5,05/19/2020,"Pastai NYC is amazing. Wow. And the prices are modest. I almost don't want to tell you this place is good because I don't want my new favourite pasta place to become crowded. As is, it feels like a neighborhood spot from the relaxed nature and the prices and the kind staff. Don't find many spots like this anymore.",Pastai Restaurant,186 9th Ave
26205,8,84,Italian,3,02/18/2023,"Paccheri alla Genovese is what I ordered and found nothing fancy about it. It just tasted average, and it is honestly I can cook this at home. Pricey for what you get; the quality is simply not there. The server was friendly and the atmosphere was nice. Pasta was $25, a small glass of Coca Cola was $6.5, let's not forget taxes and tips. I don't buy the ""this is NYC"" because I have had way better for less in the nicest areas of Manhattan. Anyway, I will not go back to this place.",Pastai Restaurant,186 9th Ave
26206,9,84,Italian,4,05/19/2020,Egg benedict and pesto sauce on pasta were great. Salad was healthy. Steak overcooked. All the dishes were a little bit salty.,Pastai Restaurant,186 9th Ave
26207,10,84,Italian,4,05/19/2022,"Absolutely lovely, chewy, fresh egg pasta. my sauce was perfectly balanced, delicate. It was not overly meaty or overly creamy. I reccomend the Reginette, so curly with sauce licking the sides. However, there was a strong blemish on an otherwise wonderful meal. The arancini, a dish found in Italian restaurants at all price ranges around entire country, was severely lacking in salt. It was incredibly average, and didn’t even feel cheesy! I was hoping for some funky from classic sheep’s milk cheese, obviously pecorino cheese but maybe something else?! I’ve had dozens of better arancini. Sorry for getting held up on the arancini but arancini is incredibly important to me. obviously the appetizer was a small portion of my eating experience but I found it to occupy a lot of my brain waves in the coming days.",Pastai Restaurant,186 9th Ave
26208,11,84,Italian,5,05/20/2019,Small but also nice. The staff was patient and answered all of my dumb questions politely. I'm always looking to try new food and I wasn't disappointed at all. Love the atmosphere and relatively short time it took to prepare my meal and drink. Will revisit this spot whenever I'm in NY.,Pastai Restaurant,186 9th Ave
26209,12,84,Italian,5,05/20/2018,"Pastai is a unique restaurant in the heart of Chelsea. Its tastefully decorated interior combines modern and traditional design and reflects the food they serve which combines traditional Sicilian cooking with a modern twist and creative flavors. The atmosphere there is, to say the least, amazing. The service is perfect, staff and host are extremely cheerful, friendly and prompt. They strive to give their customers the best experience they deserve. They cook with a lot of care and use locally grown and seasonal vegetables. They also have daily specials with unique flavors that i think you should try. My husband and I tried the Sicilian style meatballs with pine nuts and vegetables in tomato sauce -amazing. We also ordered the Black squid ink infused risotto and the pan seared scallops over a bed of kohlrabi - incredible. We finished with two deserts the Sfinci di ricotta and Tiramisu. Truly one of the best dining experience in Manhattan. If you are looking for a pleasant and warm night out with partner or friends look no further than Pastai. I highly recommend going there and experience for yourself the hospitality and the great food they offer.",Pastai Restaurant,186 9th Ave
26210,13,84,Italian,4,05/19/2020,Nice cozy little Italian restaurant. Prices are fair for New York and the portions as well. Brussels sprouts were very good as well as the risotto balls.,Pastai Restaurant,186 9th Ave
26211,14,84,Italian,5,05/20/2019,"Bottom line: upscale and intimate feel, great for date night, prices NY average, professional service, open late, overall great experience!    Gluten line: very accommodating, including GF bread, pastas, etc. No issues after!    Long line: so after leaving a concert nearby, we realized that finding a good GF meal after about 9 PM on a weekday is a bit tough. Luckily we had saved this place from a previous list I found and I'm thankful we did. The vibe is very private, intimate, with dim lighting, and only one other big table in the place when we arrived. The server was fantastic and answered all our usual bombardment of gluten related questions. The dishes were fresh and well made, and we both agreed we should return for a non-impromptu date. Would recommend even for non-celiacs and we will be returning!",Pastai Restaurant,186 9th Ave

26214,17,84,Italian,1,12/20/2022,Made a reservation they could not honor! It was thanksgiving eve and they had availability on Resy.

26216,19,84,Italian,5,05/20/2018,"First, let me say that everything here is amazing. If you want authentic fresh homemade pasta (available surprisingly late night) you can't go wrong. Their ricotta bruschetta with pistachio and honey will change the way you think about bruscetta. But don't sleep on their brunch either. Tiramisu pancakes along with steak and eggs gives you an idea of their culinary dexterity. For me, the avocado sandwich on the sidewalk patio is an incredibly fresh and light way to enjoy a summer afternoon. If you are craving classic French Fries, you'll need to go elsewhere, but if you'd like an artisanal julienned potato side, their peppery, limp version is more true to a vegetable than a junk food.",Pastai Restaurant,186 9th Ave
26217,20,84,Italian,5,05/19/2022,This restaurant was recommended to us UK visitors to NYC for the first time by native New Yorkers we met on the subway. This is one of the most authentic Italian meals I have had outside of Italy. We had three courses for two people  plus a glass of wine and a cocktail the bill was $118. It was absolutely delicious and the service as really good making us feel completely at ease as two women on our own.,Pastai Restaurant,186 9th Ave

26222,25,84,Italian,5,05/19/2020,Thoroughly enjoyed my time and meal here. I was solo and sat at the window seat (to people watch!). The server was incredibly kind and had just the right amount of attentiveness - I never felt rushed or like I was waiting too long. I had a glass of wine and the pasta with the slow cooked ragu. It was almost like a pasta stew and it was incredible. The sauce wasn’t too heavy or overbearing. But it was very nice on a cold day. The meat was so tender it would just fall apart.    I dreamt about it for days after.    The lunch menu has decent prices. I did find the wine a bit expensive (but on par with nyc in general).,Pastai Restaurant,186 9th Ave

26226,30,84,Italian,1,08/22/2022,Very disappointed. I was given the restaurant week menu which was a $60 per person not bad but I’m wanted to order from regular menu. The server said I can order anything from the prix fixed menu and they will charge it as regular but when I asked for the prices he couldn’t answer me.  Food was poorly made no flavor and cold.  Only nice thing was the decoration inside.,Pastai Restaurant,186 9th Ave

I informed the staff to let the manager know of the situation since he was not present at the time and left.  When I made the reservation the schedule on the website was different than the hours that the restaurant reflects today 7/4th otherwise I would not have been able to reserve a table for 4pm if in fact the restaurant opened at 5pm.  Very unprofessional made me look stupid in front of my guest and it was  very embarrassing.,Pastai Restaurant,186 9th Ave
26228,32,84,Italian,1,05/19/2022,"The food was good, but unfortunately it was restaurant week and price was way to high.

The host said we have no reservation, therefore the only table available is by the window (which was freezing cold.) We obliged, but as more walk-ins came by, the host offered two Caucasian girls table in the main dining room.  We know they are walk-in because we sat literally next to the door. We heard the whole conversation. It would have been nice if the host extended the same courtesy. The food was so so. The Rigenette al Ragu literally has 4 strings of meat.

We were seated immediately at our reservation time and staff gave us the perfect amount of time to look at the menu before asking us what we wanted. After ordering drinks, apps, and entre's at the same time we were ready to feast. first we were presented with an amazing bread app. Unfortunately they were out of the wine that we ordered, but the waiter, who was also the bartender (amazing) recommended us another bottle that was delicious for the same price. We order the prosciutto panini as well as the spaghetti carbonara and reginette al ragu  and everything was amazing.

26249,54,84,Italian,1,05/19/2020,"Seriously terrible food. Four dishes all way off in seasoning. Ingredients had no taste and were not fresh. Asked if I could talk to the manager and he was not there. I asked if they could do anything and they said everyone else is happy with the food. None of the staff had experience with Italian food. The staff member serving us at the bar did not even ask how the food was tasting, and or asked if we wanted another drink but just talked with other staff. This probably happens when the manager is away I am hoping as this place is highly rated but as a message to the managers your staff slacks off when your not around. 0 stars for me.",Pastai Restaurant,186 9th Ave

There are also gluten free pastas and bread available for those with gluten sensitivities. However, the overall service could be improved, particularly with punctuality/adherence to reservations. The host refused to provide us with multiple menus while we waited for our reservation (1 menu provided for 4 people).

He didn't apologize but kept stating there are other people there. I asked repeatedly what the purpose of our reservation with no answer. There was no apology or offer to buy us an app or a drink.

They use canola oil for everything which is unbelievable for an Italian restaurant...you pay 50-60usd per head, and they are still using cheap oil for everything... How is that possible? I was expecting much more fot this cozy place... Definitely, there are other options in the area where you will pay a cheaper price for a dinner of higher quality and service. Won't repeat.",Pastai Restaurant,186 9th Ave
26256,61,84,Italian,3,05/19/2022,Food was good but we ordered a filet and did not receive the correct cut of beef.  It also came improperly cooked twice.,Pastai Restaurant,186 9th Ave

26258,63,84,Italian,2,05/19/2020,Was looking forward to trying this place because the menu looked amazing. I was really disappointed. I ordered the cauliflower bucatini and it didn’t taste like anything. It only became edible when I added a ton of salt and pepper. They really need to learn what spices are. Would not recommend.,Pastai Restaurant,186 9th Ave
26259,64,84,Italian,5,05/20/2018,"Such a pleasant experience!!! Booked the backroom for my wedding celebration. The decoration is very lovely with warm colors and a home feel. I especially love how bright the room is since dim lights are popular in restaurants these days, but you'get lots of natural lights in this room.  We had 12 guests and I spend a little than $500 for a delicious three course meal and drinks, with tax and gratuity included! The portion is very generous( My grandma actually filled up on the appetizers alone lol)  I booked this venue through Tarek and he was being super supportive the whole time! I got to bring my own spotify playlist which gives such a great atmosphere in the room! We were singing along to the songs that have special meaning to us.  Everyone loved the food, it was very tasty and beautifully styled. We were eating, singing and being foolish together like one big family:D The service was also excellent and also very fast. The two gentlemen that helped our table were great:) Me & my fiance also got two glasses of sparkly wine on the house!  The meal was such a highlight of the day and everyone came home with a happy stomach and a happy heart. We've decided to come back for our anniversary:D",Pastai Restaurant,186 9th Ave

26262,67,84,Italian,5,05/20/2018,"Excellent food and very friendly service. This place has a lovely atmosphere. I started with calamari, which were in a light and crisp batter with a very tasty dip. Then I had gemelli with a lovely dollop of mozzarella, rabe pesto, and fresh cherry tomatoes. Next time I'll go with a bigger appetite and try a main course.    I live pretty far uptown, but will definitely make the effort to come back soon and often. The prices are listed as $$$, but I'd say they're closer to $$.",Pastai Restaurant,186 9th Ave
26263,68,84,Italian,5,05/20/2018,"Delicious Italian for dinner. We sat at the bar and watched the chefs hard at work while we enjoyed a few drinks and complimentary bread and dipping oil.  Limited seating, most of the tables were bar height tables.  The staff were friendly and helpful with the menu as we needed it interpreted.  The short rib ragu and squid ink, prawn and mussel pasta were cooked and served perfectly (pastas range from $20 - 28).  Pricey wine ($12 a glass), beers from $8). We saw others order cured meat and cheese plates that looked amazing.",Pastai Restaurant,186 9th Ave
26264,69,84,Italian,5,05/19/2021,Pastai is the cutest neighborhood spot for Italian food. Service is above and beyond. Food is very yummy. Tons of gluten free options. This was our second time here—will be returning soon!,Pastai Restaurant,186 9th Ave
26265,70,84,Italian,5,05/19/2020,"This restaurant is very cozy and the service is courteous and efficient. We began our meals with appetizers of olive fritters and burrata with prosciutto, both were delicious. Our main courses consisted of Garganelli burrata dinner and Torchio Genovese dinner (which consisted of rigatoni with a sauce of  braised beef and onions).  Again, both meals were fantastic. Dessert was Tiramisu.  Would recommend very highly you will not be disappointed.",Pastai Restaurant,186 9th Ave

26267,72,84,Italian,1,05/20/2019,"The ""specials"" on the menu seem to be a way to discard old expired stuff from the kitchen in this place. I had a mussels, prawns tagliatelle where the moment the dish was brought to the table, one could make out the diner quality of the food on the plate. The mussels smelly and disgusting, the prawns were just overcooked hard boiled mass sprinkled over the unremarkable pasta. I had to leave the full dish on the plate while wondering, ""Do these guys see that the customer left the whole dish intact on the plate and do they wonder if they served garbage out or just trash the dish and wait to capture the next gullible new yorker trying to find a okay looking place in Chelsea to throw their next special on?"". My wife ordered the Ravioli and it was unevenly cooked, doughy on the sides and insipid to say the least. If this was a place charging 10$ for a pasta, I would understand and give them a pass. This place charges you 20$ upwards for an entree. So if you are looking for lightening up your pocket and getting a below average experience walk in. Should have guessed from the supermarket white sliced bread served with olive oil that the incoming meal wasn't going to be anything worth writing about. But here I am :)",Pastai Restaurant,186 9th Ave

26269,74,84,Italian,2,05/20/2019,"This restaurant is super quaint and cute. We came to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday with his family.  Ordered three appetizers and a salad. Both bruschettas  were fabulous- very tasty and perfect seasoning. Brussel sprouts- we asked for no bacon since we are vegetarian and they didn't add any other seasoning to it so it was very bland. Normally if we ask for a dish vegetarian at any other restaurant, they will season it and it will taste great. not the case here. Anyways, other dishes were great so let it slide. For the main course, we ordered three pastas and two paninis.  All of the pastas had no taste, it appeared they didn't season or put salt/pepper in the dishes. There was no spice, and the pasta was very al dente- basically almost raw. One of the paninis (avocado, sunny side up eggs and tomato) was open faced, which was not indicated on the menu. If I was told it was, I wouldn't have ordered it. The bread was very had to cut and very messy to eat overall. First I asked for the eggs to be scrambled, but they came sunny side up. I told the waiter, and he literally took the eggs off and put scrambled back on top.   We told them about our issues and the food not tasting good at all, and they didn't compensate us at all. Considering we came for a special meal out, we were disappointed. I would only recommend coming for the drinks and appetizers (if that).",Pastai Restaurant,186 9th Ave

26271,76,84,Italian,5,05/20/2019,"My favorite Italian restaurant in the city. There are very few places where you remember the dish you had and want to come back. This is one of them. The menu here is very unique and nothing like you will find in nyc. The dishes are super fresh as the pasta is handmade, with imported ingredients from Italy and local fresh produce. My friend hosted her birthday here where they have a backroom - providing an intimate feel for your private party at reasonable prices. It's also a good place to catch up with a friend or for a date as it does not get too loud. Highly recommend this place!",Pastai Restaurant,186 9th Ave

Burrata appetizer was not good, burrata small portion and hard, not great ingredients.    Pasta was very sub par, ordered slow braised ragu as per recommendation, the beef was tough, pasta watery, bland, unappetizing.  Sent it back.    Carbonara was very bland, not appetizing.    Complained very vocally to waiter who just didn’t care.  Everyone that works here is mexican and not italian.   Go somewhere else",Pastai Restaurant,186 9th Ave

From the cocktails to the service I had to give this place 5 stars for being the best pasta restaurant I've been to in New York City.,Pastai Restaurant,186 9th Ave
26277,82,84,Italian,4,05/20/2018,I really enjoyed this place. It felt like a neighborhood and non-touristy place. I had the risotto balls and the ragu pasta and they were both delicious. Highly recommend this place for a quick bite at a reasonable price.,Pastai Restaurant,186 9th Ave

26282,89,84,Italian,5,05/20/2018,What an amazing find. Was walking on 9th avenue and saw the place from outside. It was very busy but the server was able to help me get in. The place is very attractive and beautiful. I sat in the bar and started my dinner with a watermelon martini. It was just perfect. I ordered the charded octopus as a start. The octopus was very tender and cooked  to perfection. What amazed me is the citrus salad that comes with the octups. It has beautiful colors and very delicious taste.  For my entree I ordered the torchio with the genovise sauce . It is grass feed frank steak with onions that cooked for 8 hours . What an unique  combination. That was my best dish I ever eat and I do eat outside a lot . Definitely the place has a unique menu that I would love  to come back to try. Highly recommended .,Pastai Restaurant,186 9th Ave
26283,90,84,Italian,1,05/20/2019,"Went here on a weekday because the reviews on google seemed good. Should have checked yelp. Should always check both and compare reviews before entering a restaurant.    I ordered a mushroom ravioli. My partner ordered from the specials. It was a seafood linguine pasta.    So we are no food snobs. But we do know italian food. And this was nothing short of a disaster. My ravioli was uncooked on the edges and tasted quite bad. Quite bad but edible.    My partner's seafood pasta was something else. The mussels smelled so bad that he could barely take two bites.    Also these guys have been astroturfing. That is how the ratings are so high.    Immediately after my partner posted his review, someone accused him of trying to malign the restaurant. 10 minutes later there was another review praising the seafood pasta and the mushroom ravioli.    Frankly it was hilarious. Astroturfing is also an art. You dont post a good FAKE review praising the same dishes 10 minutes later. That is not how it's done.     Either way, please save your money and time and go to another italian restaurant in case you are craving italian food in this neighborhood.",Pastai Restaurant,186 9th Ave

They have artisanal pasta dishes that you will not find anywhere else.I tried the Torchio with the Genovese sauce and my wife tried the special spaghetti with the clams and tuna bottarga. OMG I never had such a value for my money. The quietly , atmosphere and the service are very high. I will really recommend it .

26287,94,84,Italian,4,05/20/2018,"We found this place just walking by at around 9pm on a random Tuesday night after the Italian place we originally wanted to go to in another neighborhood was already closed. What attracted us to this place was the fact that there were about 5 tables of people inside at such an off peak time so we figured it must be good... and it was. They have great homemade pasta dishes with their own spin and a unique menu.  We tried the ricotta/honey bruschetta, fettuccini carbonara (they use guanciale instead of standard pancetta) and tagliatelle Genovese which was a braised beef / caramelized onion ragu. Everything was really good.",Pastai Restaurant,186 9th Ave

26289,97,84,Italian,3,05/20/2018,"The pasta is alright, but neither authentic nor exceptional. It was slightly overcooked, too large and mismatched to the sauce, which was made with medium-sized chunks of beef, unlike anything you would find in Italy. Also, either the pasta or the sauce hadn't been strained properly and there was some liquid in the plate, which was still very hot and almost burnt me. The focaccia they serve before the meal is a nice touch but it's a bit too spongy and soggy.",Pastai Restaurant,186 9th Ave

I think there arancini had some saffron, which I was not expecting, and they slightly burnt the garlic in the carbonara. That could be A Flavor Choice, but it's not my thing.

Dedicated parking lot and easy access as it is located right off the 3. Now the food. My wife had linguine with clam sauce and I had black spaghetti with lobster. Honestly the pasta were disappointing compared to what we were expecting with such well reviewed restaurant. They were not bad, but not good either. Just so so. Black spaghetti for me was just mostly sour and spicy without other flavor. Service wasn't great either. We were done with our food for a while and had our table clothes out on the table but the waiter would just not stop by. There were only three tables being served at the time. All in all, not a bad spot but we probably won't be returning.",Bareli's Restaurant and Bar,219 NJ-3

26845,16,87,Italian,2,04/20/2023,"I came here to celebrate my birthday on 3/25. The restaurant itself was much smaller than I imagined but there is enough space in between tables. They have live music on Saturdays but if you sit past the entry way, you will not hear it. I was under the impression I was going to enjoy a nice dinner with live music, but instead there was regular pop music playing and I could not hear the live music at all unless I sat at the bar when you first walk in.    The service was terrible. After placing our initial drink order, it did not come for about 30 mins and the waiter disappeared before taking our food orders. At times, my party felt a bit forgotten as it seemed that other tables were being regularly serviced.    The food was okay. The meats were cooked and had a good flavor but all the sides lacked seasoning.    Overall, idk if I’d go back but glad I tried.",Bareli's Restaurant and Bar,219 NJ-3

There is plenty of wait staff which made everything go seamlessly. We were offered water, olives & a fresh arrangement of bread. Our server Marvin was fantastic very friendly and attentive. We ordered the burrata & Cesear salad for appetizer. I had the Bolognese dish & my partner has the pork ragu dish. We also ordered dessert which was a delicious ricotta cheese cake & traditional tartufo. They serve many different types of wines & beverages as well. It was a great dinner and wonderful atmosphere.

The servers were A++, and the champagne and food were simply out of this world good. Each guest had a different dish and all reported it was the best they ever had. Special applause for the black spaghetti and the red snapper special.  The clams oreganata still makes my mouth water to think about.  This is a classy, well run joint with tremendous food.

Is this how they treat people with health issues, simply disgusting.  Would not recommend a place that would not accommodate a person's needs. Terrible experience.",Bareli's Restaurant and Bar,219 NJ-3
26864,37,87,Italian,2,05/20/2022,"My husband and I ate dinner at Bareli’s last Saturday night.  The food was very mediocre.  My pasta was extremely oily.  It is quite expensive also.  We did enjoy the music by the two singers which made for an enjoyable evening.  However, the owner/manager clearly knows his regulars and goes around greeting them and speaking with them.   We had never been there before.  He looked right at us and went on his way to his known customers.  I thought that was terrible .  He should have greeted all his customers, not just the one he knows.  Perhaps, the evening would have been better with some nice customer service.",Bareli's Restaurant and Bar,219 NJ-3

26867,40,87,Italian,5,05/20/2022,"I had a chance to sit down this past Friday and enjoy some food at the bar.  Everyone was so kind, the place was spotless, and the hospitality was great.    I had the East Coast Oysters which were good and most importantly fresh, and next time I'll have the Oysters Sambuca!    If you're looking for a great restaurant, look no further.  I'll be back!",Bareli's Restaurant and Bar,219 NJ-3
26868,41,87,Italian,1,08/23/2022,"Can’t say anything about the food because we never got to it but staff and customer service is abysmal. We walked in at 4:45, which is early but they’d been open for an hour at this point. They sat us, and that’s is the exact moment the staff decided to finish their prep work, including mopping the floors.  No one wants to smell cleaning chemicals while they’re eating dinner. We left because the smell made me nauseous and were receiving a very clear signal that we were not welcome because they weren’t ready.  When I told them why we were leaving they didn’t care or apologize, so, message received!  If you’re not ready for customers then don’t open.",Bareli's Restaurant and Bar,219 NJ-3

Regardless, they do take special requests and will make basically anything. Atmosphere was dark, more intimate. Food was exceptional. Service was great. Drinks were amazing, I had a red sangria and it is made in house and was delicious!! Overall, it was great. Just my honest review about little people and this place.

26880,53,87,Italian,4,05/21/2019,"My husband and I went for the first time last Saturday. The place is very nice inside. The food was pretty good, a little pricey in comparision. The valet stated he can drive stick shift and stalled out my husbands corvette, luckily, he went out there and parked it himself. We had about 3 or 4 different waiters/waitresses helping us, which was a little odd. We didn’t like that the table was super long, we could barely hear each other let alone hold each other’s hands. It was good to try though.",Bareli's Restaurant and Bar,219 NJ-3

The service is great. I will absolutely take into consideration going back again if I ever land the possibility. Me as well as my pal bought the sandwiches as well as we were not dissatisfied. My one tip is to maintain the cool exterior. Till next time!",Bareli's Restaurant and Bar,219 NJ-3

Calm peaceful place with lots of fun and food !!!! Pastas were yummiest garlic bread was way too good overall we had pleasant experience for all of us and no nobody was disappointed!!! Non vegetarians told their food was yummiest too !!! So guys do try if you are planning to head !!!,Bareli's Restaurant and Bar,219 NJ-3
26885,58,87,Italian,4,05/21/2019,I tried the house draught beer and the dish of the day which was some fish dish. Food and beer was good. Bread is served while you wait for food. Just go easy on the bread as the serving portion to me looked generous. Then again I am used to Canadian serving size. So in hindsight the servings is about what you would expect at most dining places in the NY area. Parking is by valet. I was with colleague so I am not sure whether you have to pay for parking. It looked busy though for sure.    Service promptness was OK given it was a busy time. Staff were friendly. All in all it is a decent place for some good food. Would recommend reservation prior to visit as they get full house.,Bareli's Restaurant and Bar,219 NJ-3
26886,59,87,Italian,5,05/20/2020,"Found a superb place to celebrate a milestone birthday by coincidence. Sumptuous cuisine but what made the experience so enjoyable was the server, in particular our tall wonderfully voiced waiter who doted on us all. Quality cuisine with consummate service",Bareli's Restaurant and Bar,219 NJ-3
26887,60,87,Italian,3,05/20/2020,My family has been going to Bareli's since the 90's. Usually very dependable and good service. Christmas Eve dinner was mediocre at best. It's probably one of their busiest nights of the year but it seems like the overall quality had gone steadily down over the past couple of years. I think five out of my ten family members ordered the surf and turf. The lobster was the size of a jumbo shrimp and tasteless. The steak was like shoe leather. Very unusual for a place that we've enjoyed for most major holidays every year. We'll probably go to Grissini next Christmas Eve. The fact that it has taken 2 months for the restaurant to notice a lower than average review speaks volumes.,Bareli's Restaurant and Bar,219 NJ-3
26888,61,87,Italian,5,05/21/2018,"I loved it, they made feel at home while having great food and service. I had their famous lobster for the main and calamari for the app along with their multiple different types of breads and olives. The drinks were made correctly and the staff was just some of the most on point staff I've ever seen. Anyone who walked by would ask if I needed anything and if I did they wouldn't hesitate to get it to me themselves. I'd definitely go back if I'm in the area again.",Bareli's Restaurant and Bar,219 NJ-3

26890,63,87,Italian,5,05/21/2019,"Could not ask for more. Met all of our expectations and then some. From great food to great atmosphere and even great staff. The live music just put it over the top. The only thing to keep in mind is the the food arrives under salted, salt is available on the table and you should salt to your preference. Glad to have come back and will be returning again.",Bareli's Restaurant and Bar,219 NJ-3
26891,64,87,Italian,5,05/21/2019,"Excellent meal and service!! This place was a great surprise..we had the crab ravioli as an app was outstanding as was the lamb meatballs app. The thing to try is their pork chop.

Having not been to metlife for a couple years it was so wonderful to enjoy seeing our Gmen and having a great meal at Bs...what a treat we got to hear a young man sing happy birthday to a patron.

26898,71,87,Italian,5,05/20/2020,The food is fantastic. Service was terrific. Went for New Year's Eve. I was supposed to be a Roaring Twenties theme. The DJ didn't even have the Charleston so you could dance. That was very disappointing.,Bareli's Restaurant and Bar,219 NJ-3
26899,72,87,Italian,1,05/21/2019,"The service was nice but the place does not deserve all the good reviews. Not better than Olive Garden.  The food has too much oil in everything (I am a Chef). The special fish for $36 came with a couple of uncooked potatoes. We ordered a side of pasta for $10 and in all truth the portion was too small and oily.  I had several seafood salad in my life, and this one was lacking in tasty. It was very greasy and mainly calamari on it.  The last crazy insulting thing was that we had a gift card of $150. We used $110 and they wouldn't allow us to give the rest as a tip. They insisted on us leaving it separately. We had to use my American Express, they changed me $1 on it and I left a tip of $20 Can you believe this? They have the policy of not allowing the tip to come out if the gift card so that customers come back. What kind of nonsense is that? You took the money of the person who bought the card. What does it matter? You are deceiving the purpose of a gift. If it is a gift I shouldn't pay for anything!!!",Bareli's Restaurant and Bar,219 NJ-3

26901,74,87,Italian,1,01/20/2023,Way over priced For what is offered.  Hidden fees which come when time to pay.  Not worth what one pays for,Bareli's Restaurant and Bar,219 NJ-3
26902,75,87,Italian,4,05/21/2016,Nice place and great staff.  Everyone was very nice and ready to please.  We were there for Valentine's Day and enjoyed ourselves a lot. Stayed far beyond dessert at our table and there was no pressure at all for us to hurry up and move from our table. In fact Leo ( not sure if he is the owner or just a manager) bought us a round just because while we sat there talking. Now to the food. The food was good. My wife's Chilean Sea Bass and broccoli Rabe were great. I had the filet mignon which was good but not great.  But who goes to an Italian restaurant for steak. Don't get me wrong it was not bad in any way but the sauce missed the mark for me. Dessert was good and we'll definitely be back to try the pasta and some more fish. Customer service was top notch from start to finish and I would definitely recommend it.,Bareli's Restaurant and Bar,219 NJ-3

It was as if you knew we were going there for dinner because that's how you made us feel with every song you played and sang to. How could you have known?!  Trust me when I say that I don't have a musical fiber in my whole body. Nor can I carry a tune worth a dime. But as you know, music is such that when it is played and performed by a professional entertainer such as yourself, magic seems to happen within those who do not possess such an extravagant gift from God himself. In reality, you made a grand present for us with that gift that was given to you.  No doubt we will be back at Barelli's and I'll tell you why. We had a gift card in my pocket for the meal we enjoyed but you swept us away down Memory Lane so far that we forgot we even had it with us, LOL!! So we'll just have to come back again and use it.  Of all the people you may personally know in your field of work, maybe I'm the only taxidermist who ever sent you an email of appreciation and I assure you it is very well deserved to say the least. Once again, thanks so much for playing your sound for us tonight, you made us fall in love all over again!!!

There were a bit of crumbs we had to clear out of the seats. It took a long while before our server came. Carlos was our server and he was nice. For my drink I got the espresso martini and tried to get a second but that one was warm and thick so I switched to the lemon drop martini. It was strong but not too tasty but I drank it anyway. For my meal I got the create your own pasta with spaghetti, grilled chicken and traditional marinara. It came out and looked good. I dug in but had to add some salt and pepper. The bill was decent and so was everything else.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,510 Woodbridge Center Dr

It was my birthday and many others so the staff serenaded everyone (except me, by choice I might add) with the OG birthday song. By the end of our dinner I think everyone was tired of the song. Lol service was good and food was delicious as always. I would just advise that staff wear masks when singing to patrons, for now anyway.

We had ordered fettuccine Alfredo and endless soup, breadsticks and salad. We requested the soup first and the soup was hot and cold in pockets. They had microwaved the soup and the taste was awful!  The waiter apologized again and got us another bowl of soup. She got the bread sticks after we finished our soup and forgot our salad! We waited for the Alfredo for like 45 min and the waiter had completely forgotten our order. When she came back with the Oder the pasta was uncooked and tasted awful! We returned the dish back and requested for a full refund which was given to us grudgingly! The restrooms omg! You would catch an infection if you used it! Worst place ever.  I wish google had a negative rating system and I would gladly give it to them!!!",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,510 Woodbridge Center Dr

It’s upsetting to order something and not get what you paid for. Today I order Stuffed Ziti Fritta and it was NOT fried. I was scared to eat it because the stuffing looked raw! I went back to get the entree cooked correctly and still they gave me the same raw looking food. I attached pictures of my meal. It’s supposed to be deep fried like lasagna fritta.

On top of all this she made sure our order was prioritized She was also concerned on later arriving guests' food which made the service from her skyrocket.  Please give this woman a raise or something because she is and an exemplary example of amazing service.  Her attitude lit up my day and left me smiling as I left this restaurant.  Kudos Cammy.

We had Joel as our waiter  and he was one of the most attentive and sweet souls ever. Such a hard working young man. We also met George he was the chef I believe and very nice, humble and respectful.

27158,40,88,Italian,5,04/20/2023,"When you think of a culinary pilgrimage through the heart of Italy, naturally Olive Garden comes to mind. And why wouldn't it? Set in the romantic ambiance of a bustling strip mall, this fine dining establishment offers a taste of the Old Country that rivals, well, maybe not Grandma's homemade lasagna, but it's definitely up there.    Enter the ""Tour of Italy"" dish, a veritable smorgasbord of Italian classics, each more authentic than the last. I mean, who needs a plane ticket when you can indulge in a gastronomic getaway just a short drive from your suburban abode? With this trio of Chicken Parmigiana, Fettuccine Alfredo, and Lasagna Classico, you'll be whisked away to the Italian countryside in no time.    Let's discuss the Chicken Parmigiana, a dish that has me questioning if it was indeed crafted by the hands of culinary maestros or simply lovingly prepared in a slightly-too-small kitchen. Regardless, the crispy breading and generous layer of cheese provide an appetizing adventure in each bite.    And the Fettuccine Alfredo? A creamy delight that, despite its modest origins in the Olive Garden kitchen, transports your taste buds to a quaint Roman trattoria. Is it just me, or can you hear the gondoliers singing in the distance?    Finally, the Lasagna Classico. A veritable slice of Italy in all its layered glory. One can't help but wonder if this dish was inspired by the leaning tower of Pisa – it may not stand perfectly straight, but it certainly captures the essence of Italian culture.    Now, don't get me wrong, Olive Garden may not quite compare to dining on a terrace overlooking the Tuscan countryside, but it does deliver a genuinely enjoyable meal. In all seriousness, the Tour of Italy is a tasty and satisfying dish that showcases the best of what this chain restaurant has to offer. If you're seeking a little taste of Italy without the jet lag, give it a try. Buon appetito!",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,510 Woodbridge Center Dr
27159,41,88,Italian,2,02/19/2023,"This place has gone WAY downhill. We had dinner there yesterday and not only was the pasta cold upon arrival (I mean, how does one let pasta sit so long as to get cold??), but there was a guy (guest) cleaning his work boots off in the corner with a serving napkin at his family's table. He wasn't even trying to be discreet, just sitting there in his socks and cleaning them with no regard to the settings around him. Several servers passed by him and not one asked him to do that elsewhere.    In a nutshell, if you want pasta, breadsticks, and inappropriate table manners, just dine at home. I gave 2 stars; one for our waitress who did her best with the crazy atmosphere and another star for my chicken in my scampi dish.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,510 Woodbridge Center Dr

27164,46,88,Italian,1,05/20/2022,"My boyfriend and I went here to celebrate a special occasion and it was definitely a disappointment. We ordered a water and soda with the plan to order a couple of adult beverages after we ordered the food. We also ordered the shrimp appetizer (which was good, but pretty much the only good thing about our experience). We waited for a little while, still with the menus, and then the waitress dropped the appetizer on our table said the salad and breadsticks would be out shortly then left the table. Which left us confused as we still hadn’t ordered our main dishes. She brought the salad out a little while later and looked like she was going to walk away again, so we stopped her and said we were ready to order. The soups came out and the food came out, but were just dropped on the table. Nobody checked on us and nothing was cleared off the table, including the menus. No one returned until we pressed the get server button and even still it was a good 15 min wait for them to come. We weren’t asked if we wanted desert or anything else. We asked for boxes to wrap up the food then paid the bill through the digital payment system. No thank you or have a good night and we were made to feel ignored and unwelcome. Will likely not return to this location as this is the second bad experience we have had here.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,510 Woodbridge Center Dr

Then my wife got in the car and said the server asked her If I removed the tip from the table?? Which I went back inside and assured her I didn't just check your cameras and you will see who took it! Then she told me they don't have cameras?? Really it's 2022 get with the times!! I replaced the tip!! And that will be the last time we ever step foot on there!!!!!

27166,48,88,Italian,5,11/21/2022,I have been meaning to leave a review but I always forgot. This Olive Garden is absolutely amazing. Back when I had my jaw surgery in April they went above and beyond to make it more easy for me to eat due to being wired shut. I requested that they drain my gnocchi soup and they did!! They made sure there was only liquid. Thank you again,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,510 Woodbridge Center Dr

27169,51,88,Italian,5,11/21/2022,"The establishment is what you would expect from the typical Olive Garden but that’s where the similarities end. The thing that made this visit different was purely because of the service we received from our server, Chris. The service she provided is what diners could only wish to get when at a restaurant. She was always around to see if we needed anything, quick to provide what we requested and she was pleasant amongst other things. At least to me whenever we dine out, the service makes all the difference. There could be issues with the food being cold or being the wrong order but if the server shows that there’s effort there to take care of you, could you really be too mad? Of course not! Our server did a fantastic job taking care of us on this visit.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,510 Woodbridge Center Dr

Make reservations ahead is recommended.    Post meal evaluation...Got the sirloin steak...Stuff chicken marsala, shrimp & chicken carbonara...Well...It's just subpar...Nothing to died for.  Steak is not medium.  1 look well done...Other look medium.  I guess it's hit or missed.  ",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,510 Woodbridge Center Dr

27175,57,88,Italian,2,05/21/2019,"The policy of this place is extremely stupid. They give breadsticks for free, and either a soup or salad with an entree. We had 5 people and ordered 4 entrees because of the crazy amount of food they choose to give, and because none of us eat a lot so we didn't want to waste it. You are allowed to have unlimited soups or salads with the entree, but we did not order a single extra one. So we had 4 entrees, and four soup or salad (without taking advantage of it's unlimited quantity), and ordered an appetizer. At the end of it, we saw they had charged for an extra salad because there was an extra person there. Excuse me? I'm getting the amount of food that I am paying for, and you're telling me it's your policy to charge for an empty plate? In what restaurant does staff get to decide how much I should pay based on who ate the food I paid for? I would get it if we ordered an extra free soup or salad for the last person, but we didn't. If you don't like it, stop giving so much food away for free. After all that, we still had food left over. Manager comped the extra they had tacked on, but still tried to convince me that this ridiculous policy made sense. The two stars are because most of the food tasted good.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,510 Woodbridge Center Dr

However, the meatball was pretty weird and kind of tasted a bit undercooked. Of coursed, I wasn’t surprised as it must be hard to thoroughly cook a huge meatball.

27187,69,88,Italian,2,05/21/2019,"Went for dinner for 2 and had a 45 min wait. The wait was not bad for a Saturday night but waiting in the front by the podium and watching 6 employees buy and eat girl scout cookies in front of people was horrible. I believe the wait could have been less if they didn't have 6 people seating customers, when they could help bus tables and serve.  Poor workforce management.  The server Richie was good precise and attentive but the 5 cheese fondue was burnt and hard we sent it back and it was off the bill. Will not eat there again.  Staff or management needs retraining. I have worked in a five star restaurant establishment and I know how things should be ran and there is no teamwork at this olive garden.    The day after posting the review Olive Garden contacted me and gave me a $35 card for the bad experience.

27245,129,88,Italian,2,05/20/2022,This place is falling apart.  The service was just okay but my my concern is the general up keep.   The soap dispenser in the bathroom fell apart when I tried to get soap and the paper towel dispenser is being held together with tape. While trying to eat i couldn't help but notice that the plant decor just above our table on the dividing wall was completely covered in dust. It was kind of disgusting and my daughter couldn't finish her meal because of it.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,510 Woodbridge Center Dr

27250,134,88,Italian,2,05/20/2022,"I used to love going to Olive Garden. First time there since before the pandemic. The menu was downsized which is understandable, but it went from a good chain restaurant to an overpriced fast food establishment. The portions of food for the price is ridiculous. My daughter has had a better 99 cent Celeste frozen pizza than the one they serve. Extremely disappointed.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,510 Woodbridge Center Dr

27253,137,88,Italian,3,05/20/2022,"The good: Wait time went fast even though it was packed.  Food was good, but soup was barely warm.  Our waiter was attentive even though he had about 5 tables besides us.    The bad: The bartender was chomping away on a straw as he made drinks, which really grossed me out.  Lots of litter everywhere on the floor as many employees stood around.  The fake plants had 2 inches of dust on them.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,510 Woodbridge Center Dr

27256,140,88,Italian,2,05/20/2022,"I generally have no issue with Olive Garden, however, I can state they (this location and others?) could improve the security here by installing some cameras so they have a record of who comes and goes. I dealt with what I would classify as an attempted assault but can't really prove anything.    At least we got fresh bread-sticks this time, and the meatsauce was especially delicious.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,510 Woodbridge Center Dr

27258,142,88,Italian,2,05/20/2022,Where do I begin.  When entering you can see litter all over floor. I nearly stumbled on a crayon on the floor near me when I was getting up to leave.  Mind you for the hour and half we were there no one swept but there were hostesses playing a handclapping game.  Waiter was very attentive but seems he was expecting to take our order within 2 minutes of seating. We both ordered the chicken and shrimp carbonara which reads it has red peppers and bacon- plenty of red peppers but not even a taste of bacon and we were told its in the sauce.  The food wasn't bad tasting just no bacon.  Bathroom needed a cleaning as well.  Although women should be a bit neater about themselves...like why is there toilet paper on the floor?!?!?  you are right there by a toilet. Some females need to do better in the cleanliness department.  Cant stand dirty females.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,510 Woodbridge Center Dr

They took care of all of our needs very quickly, and they seem to have no problem accommodating for allergies and portion sizes. The food itself was okay, I feel like they need to season their pasta and sauces better, my chicken alfredo was on the bland side. My partners chicken parmesan was very good but again on the bland side.

I took my aunt to eat here and I felt so embarrassed. My utensils were dirtied. I have a service dog and asked for a booth for some more privacy which took 10 minutes to get seated in an empty resturant. The food was either too salty or cooked uneven. My order came out wrong as well. I am furious and extremely unsatisfied. If you want better food, I recommend the dumpster in the back of the bahama breeze.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,510 Woodbridge Center Dr

On Friday July 23 went back with my family a party of 5 for a second chance. The host sat us down immediately, the restaurant was not busy, but we waited 15 minutes before a waitress approached us. Order was taken asked for salad and bread up front. Brought out our drinks, the Coors light beer had no lable on it and no glass was offered, the SPIKED strawberry, lemonade was not spiked, but charged. The salad and bread was delivered about 10 minutes later. The food was delivered about 10 minutes after that. The waitress was not proberly trained and had no knowledge on how to serve and interact with her customers. Overall the food was good but service was not. Will not return to Olive garden again after 2 bad experiences.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,510 Woodbridge Center Dr

This particular place had a terrible odor upon entering. The men's room was unclean.The hostess was overwhelmed by our request to not be seated where she attempted to put us; her attitude was less than desirable. My food was over cooked (Fettuccine Alfredo) and my (steak) under cooked. Nevertheless, our waitress was pretty spot on; she accounted for both stars and a 30% tip.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,510 Woodbridge Center Dr

Unfortunately recently I came to the restaurant only to be seated at a table that was sticky and clearly not cleaned. waiter moved me to the table next to it and that table was dirty as well and sticky. The waiter himself said is was not ok that his co-workers left this table dirty especially during the covid pandemic we are living in. They have to do better.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,510 Woodbridge Center Dr

I arrive and call the restaurant letting them know the parking spot number and that I’m outside. Lady over the phone said someone would bring my food shorty.    I waited for 20 minutes and no one showed up. So I decide to go inside and explain I was waiting for so long. No apologies or anything.    I was so excited for my meal only to be fed up and annoyed by their actions. Not to mention my food wasn’t hot anymore. So yeah. I order from here all the time and never had an issue besides the occasional forgetfulness to include utensils here and there.

But, tonight our server, Vladimir made our experience even better.   He was attentive,  professional,  courteous,  and he checked up on us several times throughout our dinner to see if everything is ok as if he's your family feeding you from his home.  If you go to this Olive Garden,  ask for Vladimir as your server.  He was super nice to our family -(2 adults and 3 kids.), I'm sure he'll take care of yours too.  He's the best!

27284,168,88,Italian,2,05/20/2022,"So normally I love Olive Garden. But this place.. yikes. Very dirty from the bathroom to the silverware. Literal chunks of leftover food on our clean silverware. How is that acceptable especially during COVID?! We waited forever for our server and finally had to just ask someone else for drinks. Our server checked on us maybe two times total and was very distracted goofing off with the other servers. And to make it even worse, they completely changed the fried calamari. It used to be delicious and crunchy! Now it’s like microwaved mush, the breading on it is gross. Stop fixing things that don’t need to be fixed.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,510 Woodbridge Center Dr

Managers should be proud of the excellent customer service and our waiter was great. We never had an empty glass and didn't have to go looking for him when we needed something. The service is the only reason this place gets 4 stars. The food is just eh at best.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,510 Woodbridge Center Dr

The food is typical and good but don't expect to eat anything approaching healthy. The two problems here are the lack of a good marinara sauce (almost everything has a cream based sauce) and, while the service of salads, soups and appetizers is quick, the wait for entrees and sandwiches is always long",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,510 Woodbridge Center Dr

The restaurant was  very busy that day, and especially at that time (about 5:45 pm), however there is never an excuse for bland and tasteless fare. Especially since this brand supposedly prides themselves on being exceptional.  The food seemed as though it was hurriedly prepared, and not thoroughly cooked. The meals were overly salty and not really flavorful overall.

27307,192,88,Italian,5,05/20/2021,This olive garden was great. But it was all due to the waitress her name was jenny. She was on her game.

27308,193,88,Italian,5,05/20/2020,"We had Stephanny as our server and she made the experience awesome. I mean, the company I was with was better, but, since she wasn't part of that group, she was so attentive and helpful and kind that I kind of wish she was. She was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu, suggested certain dishes over others that we were very satisfied with, and was prompt in refreshing our beverages, the unlimited salad, and unlimited breadsticks. If we come back I would literally request her and be disappointed if she weren't available. Unrelated --- the women's restroom was disgusting --- which I reported to someone who said it was ""being taken care of"" but I didn't believe him.

The interiors of the restaurant was very clean and there was lost of space for sitting. We ordered different kinds of pastas and sandwiches and they were all very good. The food was served warm just at the right temperature. All in all, a place not to be missed.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,510 Woodbridge Center Dr

27323,208,88,Italian,2,05/21/2019,We have gone here a few times with hopes it will get better.  Unfortunately it has not. The food was ok but the service not so much.  We sat for 15 minutes before we asked someone to take our drink order.  We also had to ask for bread. Server seemed annoyed and distracted.  Took forever to get my wine.  A manager did come over to give us our bread and to tell us dinner will be out shortly. We did not see our server again until it was ready to pay the bill.

Started feeling intense stomach pains, gas, nauseousness, sweats. About 5 minutes after I almost fainted. All I ate was two bread sticks and half of a chicken alfredo entre.

However, when we were seated the young man and the young lady really did well serving us, wish I remembered their names. Very well done on that end. Thank you.    ***Previous Review Below***  This place deserves negative stars. The workers don’t want to work and on a random Wednesday night when it’s cold and wet, and their parking lot is empty, the wait time is 45 mins or more. This place is a bad influence for Olive Garden.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,510 Woodbridge Center Dr
27328,214,88,Italian,2,05/20/2020,I was very disappointed in the customer service. Today my husband and I were not escorted like usual to a table we were just told that if we were ok with a high table table then one of the employees pointed out a table. When we approach the table it was dirty and food under the table. To put the coating the waiter was not on point with her customer service.   This is not a norm for Olive Garden. Maybe next time I hope we are treated better then this evening,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,510 Woodbridge Center Dr

Table was not cleaned properly, there were crumbs on the table and the bench. Waitress comes took our order, brought appetizers but no plates. Then we got the salad but still no plates. She got us the plates and says breadsticks are still  in the oven. Finally, we got the breadsticks and soon after that we got our entrees. Food was good but waitress didn't come and check if everything was okay and just came to ask if we will pay using the order monitor on the table. As we were walking out I noticed napkins, paper covers on straws were on the floor. It was just dirty with poor service.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,510 Woodbridge Center Dr

The apps, drinks and meals for our party of eight all came out in a timely fashion and everything was delicious.

27336,222,88,Italian,1,05/20/2020,"Ordered take out for the first time here because the dining room was closed.  I emailed my order in at 2:47pm and it was supposed to be ready at 3:12pm.  I arrived a little early at 3:05pm. The order didn't come out until 3:42pm, which is 30 minutes past the pickup time. So, from the time I ordered until the food was ready was 55 minutes, which is unacceptable.  My family and I have eaten here many times  when the restaurant was full and we never had to wait that long from the time we placed our order until  the food arrived.  Also, we ordered one slice of Black Tie Chocolate Mousse cake for $7.99.  It is a very small piece and should be one half the price that they charge.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,510 Woodbridge Center Dr
27337,223,88,Italian,5,05/20/2020,The food was really good. I truly enjoyed myself. I had a taste for Olive Garden and they definitely please my tastebuds.

27339,225,88,Italian,1,05/21/2019,"I went here with my girlfriend, who moved here from Washington State. I’m 22, and she’s 23. The manager was very rude to her, and tried saying he was also from Washington State and that her ID was a fake. It was her first day in the area so she had her birth certificate and social security on her. All she wanted was a fruity alcoholic drink after the flight and to have a good date with me. The MANAGER threw her ID on the table and tried quizzing her about where she was from. He was loud and embarrassing! On top of it our waiter was nice, and we were sat down quickly, but I watched a sweat bead off of his head go into my water...  I was very upset at the rude hospitality we received, and I did call the corporate number. I hope no one else had a bad experience like we had.

27340,226,88,Italian,2,05/22/2014,"The landscaping outside is nice. They have a flower that gives off a beautiful scent when walking toward the establishment. When arrived inside the host area was descent. The hostess took us to our table. The waiter was nice ,but also didn't seem to care. I noticed while I was waiting to be greeted the other patrons were also just hanging around waiting for service. We probably waited to give our order about 7 minutes that felt like 20 minutes When the food arrived the portion of food to the plate on one order was a joke. The steak was plopped onto the plate with over cooked or been sitting there for hours potatoes and peppers on HUGE plate. The other food was served with sauce on top. Presentation was VERY POOR.    I CAN SAY THE BREAD STICKS WERE PRETTY GOOD when we finally got them.    Maybe this visit was just bad timing I would like to come back again and maybe it will be a good day/night to visit. But I won't be there anytime soon.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,510 Woodbridge Center Dr

They didn't fall behind once and still made sure the sitting customer's received the best possible service. Thank you Jersey and Erik.

27343,229,88,Italian,3,05/20/2020,Food was good but what is the deal with always a wait. Even with a bunch of empty tables. I would say it was a staff shortage but there was 4 people at the hostess station. Do you think if you make us wait it's more desirable or just not enough servers.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,510 Woodbridge Center Dr

And me being a pure vegetarian, I look for options that can make me happy. And they always take care to serve exactly what I want. Their 5 cheese Ziti and creamy pesto is to die for.  Even the servers are very friendly and humble. I would love to specify the name of a server who served me recently April Rose who made sure that everything came to my table was better then any of my visits before. Also when I told her that I love their mint candies which they give at the time of check. She actually bought me a handful of them and got all smiles on my face.

We called to let them know and overheard then say to another worker that it was another call for a missing item. They then put my husband on hold. The phone call was then disconnected.

Pros: the dining room was quiet & very well spaced (There were only 3 tables in use while we ate).  The staff was diligent in their disinfectant process.  The food was what you would expect at OG... except they gave extra sauce to my omma without any issues (you'd be surprised how some OG's treat meat sauce like gold. Lol)  Devin (our waiter) was great. Best experience at OG in 2020.    Recommend or no? Recommend.

The problem we had was for the service. Our waiter Kevin was a hard man to find throughout the meal In fact many times we had to ask another waiter to find him. Our BIGGEST complaint was that we were seated in the booth right in earshot and sight of the host stand. Explain to me why there were 4-5 young people  up there conversating and cursing as if it were recess? Was there not a table to bus? Dishes to be washed?  Food to be served? Where was the Manager?

Other than the salad and bread sticks, anything I've ordered there has been underwhelming. Not bad, not enough to complain, or send it back, just enough that I feel like ate food, but didn't enjoy it. Like when you're hungry and you settle for whatever's around. They often have dirty silverware and often times their servers seem dismissive or even confused, as if every time I go there its the servers first day. My mom enjoys it, so when she wants to go I go too. Like I said, it's not an awful experience, just kind of ... unimpressive.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,510 Woodbridge Center Dr
27362,248,88,Italian,2,05/20/2020,"I was thrilled to come here for the endless pasta bowl. The salad and breadsticks were good ,they are always  consistent with that. I tried the new pasta sauce ;roasted garlic . It was very watery, barely  had flavor  and ,needed some salt. This is not authentic Italian food. Then I ordered the  5 cheese Marinara, I did not see cheese at all.  To make matters more worse the sauce tasted like it came out of a can . Not pleased at all; the positive side is that the endless pasta bowl starts at 10.99.

27365,252,88,Italian,1,05/20/2020,"Sorry for the NOVEL but this review was absolutely necessary.    Will never be returning to this location again. Our server SONIA was too busy yapping away, she couldn't do her job correctly. It was before the dinner rush and she had about 3-4 tables at the most but clearly couldn't handle it. Made us wait 20 minutes for our salads, then another 15 minutes after that for the breadsticks. She came by briefly ONCE after our food was out and that was her last visit to our table. But more than our disservice, I was more annoyed with how the table next to us was being treated by her. She came by the table next to us where there was a family of 3 celebrating grandma's birthday. It was clear that some disabilities were present and their patience and kindness was being taken advantage of. Grandma was wheelchair bound and it seemed like they wanted to have their dessert and be on their way. They waited about 30 minutes to place their dessert order with Sonia. (When we were seated, this family had already finished eating and was waiting to order dessert.) We heard the servers singing happy birthday to someone at a nearby table so the lady mentioned to the server that it was mom's birthday at the time they ordered. The dessert was brought out and Sonia walked over annoyed and had the audacity to ask grandma, ""do you want me to sing happy birthday to you??"". She nodded yes and to that she let out a sigh and told her, ""oh ok I'll go find people to sing for you then."" And to no one's surprise, SHE NEVER RETURNED. Grandma sat there staring at her dessert for about 15-20 minutes until I had enough of the BS. I got up and asked to speak to the manager. Sonia magically appeared once I walked up to speak to her manager and looked very confused. I told the manager, Lisa, exactly what happened at our table AND spoke on the behalf of the table next to us. Lisa immediately jumped in and took care of everything. Our 'buy 1 take 1' meal finally came out and this whole process probably took another 10 minutes. We wished grandma a happy birthday and let them know that I had voiced their nasty experience as well. The mom thanked us and as we were walking out, I finally heard.2 peoples voices singing happy birthday to grandma.    Ridiculous. I believe the server knew exactly what she was doing. She knew exactly which tables she could neglect and get away with. People like her shouldn't be in the servicing industry.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,510 Woodbridge Center Dr

The calamari was overcooked and taste like dry rubber, the fritters were also over cooked and the filling had a funny taste and they never gave me my mozzarella sticks and when the waitress went in the back to see what happen she brought me sticks that looked like they were barely cooked.

The girl that took care of our drinks and food needs was very nice and very friendly we had a good time joking back and forth which made for a nice afternoon. The two soups my friend and I had were delicious and you can have as much as you like and with the fresh grated cheese that really took it over the top. Well after all that soup and all you can eat breadsticks plus the drinks we were both full and took our lasagna lunches home which we heated up later that night and they were very good as well.

27374,261,88,Italian,1,05/21/2018,I just went the other night with my husband and one year old. I had the chicken gnocchi soup and found a giant piece of plastic in my soup!! I pulled someone aside to tell them and he goes ew that’s disgusting and takes the soup no sorry..nothing.. he then sends someone out with a new soup.. I’m like that’s it? No manager to apologize.. nothing?? So honestly at this point I’m so frustrated and just want to leave.. I had to be THAT customer and ask to speak to a manager which I never do. Manager comes over it’s the ew that’s disgusting GUY.. Clearly they need more experienced management here.. was looking for someone mature enough to realize having  a giant piece of plastic in my soup is not okay.

The bottom of the pasta was not even sauced just plain! i usually enjoy Olive Garden however dining in vs curbside is a big difference.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,510 Woodbridge Center Dr

Lots of people open restaurants because their families tell them their cooking can't be beat.  Operating a restaurant is a far cry from cooking a lot of sauce for the family.  I love this place for it's consistency.  If I'm hungry I want the dish I order and NOT potluck depending on which cook happened to get my l order.  Yeah, I'm known to be a foodie but everything has its time and place.  Love the place and value.

Everything was really good the only thing I didn't really care for was the lasagna it tastes like chef boyardee in a can food but, the chicken parm was very crispy and tasted excellent and the Alfredo marinara was very good.

27411,298,88,Italian,2,05/20/2020,I went to this Olive Garden to use a gift card i had gotten as a gift. First of all it's way to expensive for just regular every day pasta in a casual chain restaurant.  My pasta was very watery and only had a small amount of sauce around the edges and the middle was plain pasta with nothing on it.I got the grilled chicken on it and it was a small piece and not seasoned or anything. It was over all just very basic and unimpressive. Also the menu is very limited.

The 1/2 price drinks are a bonus if you can’t be seated right away. We could have made a meal of the salad and breadsticks, but we enjoyed: eggplant parm, cucina Mia, spaghetti meat sauce and sausage, chicken margherita. The chicken margherita was served with grilled zucchini instead of pasta—very diet friendly. Our server Jallissa was a delight: energetic enthusiastic and intuitive.

Be careful if u get a waitress named Ronda, cause trust me you don’t want her. Why your asking?? It is because everyone’s food going to come at a different time and when u get the first plate and are waiting for the second you WILL NOT see this waitress until 30 minutes. If you call the manager he will comp you something but it’s not acceptable. He doesn’t even say sorry. If you want your food to be comped than go here.

My youngest son was passed out asleep and even though we were originally seated at a regular table, my husband asked to be switched to a booth which they quickly accommodated. Joe was our server and he was so sweet and helpful. Our appetizers took a little long, and the manager on duty kept us updated and informed. The kids make came out quickly without even having to ask(bonus!!!), And when our spinach and fonduta appetizers came out they were hot and delicious. I ordered an amazing toffee macchiato that I could have drank forever. For dinner i opted for the steak and fettuccini which zucchini slices and the zucchini was so tasty!! My steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare and the fettuccini rivaled my grandma Conte's.

17162,66,50,Italian,2,02/18/2023,"I recently visited the Olive Garden at Times Square in New York and was disappointed by the experience. While the food was decent, the staff made for a negative overall experience. From the moment I walked in, I was met with disinterested and unaccommodating staff members who seemed put out by the fact that I was there. This unfriendliness continued throughout my visit, and it really took away from the enjoyment of my meal.    While I appreciate good Italian food, the lack of customer service at this location of Olive Garden left a bad taste in my mouth. I wouldn't recommend this location to anyone looking for a friendly and welcoming atmosphere. Instead, there are many other Italian restaurants in the city where you can get great food and better customer service.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,2 Times Sq
30106,0,103,Italian,2,06/29/2022,The server was great. Service not too much. We were only served breads ONCE. We asked for another order and were told they were being made but never arrived. For some reason Olive Garden does not like serving salads and breadsticks. They purposely bring breadsticks so late that you will give up the thought of asking for it again. This location is VERY notorious for taking too long purposely to serve salad and breadsticks. You guys need to learn from Mexican restaurants who refill chips and sauce at a fairly acceptable time frame.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,762 US-202

Food is pretty decent... we didnt try a whole lot... minestrone soup was on thinner side but pasta and mozzarella sticks were good.  Overall a once a while worth place.  Staff is also very hospitable.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,762 US-202
30119,14,103,Italian,2,06/29/2022,"I know it's an olive garden. You know what to expect. But still a little disappointed with this location. We asked for a high chair and never got one, so I just went and grabbed one by myself. The waitress never refilled my water(I drink alot). Finally, after all this, they bring kit dessert out frozen... Frozen tiramisu because they ran out. Overall, poor service, and will not be coming back.  Addl: the ac is broken in one of the sections. Makes it uncomfortable and hot.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,762 US-202
30120,15,103,Italian,4,05/26/2019,"Excellent food and overall good service. Would give 5 stars,  but our waitress did not add spinach to my wife's entree as requested,  nor did she explain why it wasn't added. At least we didn't get charged for the spinach. Will definitely go back.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,762 US-202
30121,16,103,Italian,4,05/26/2017,"The Olive Garden is one of my go-to spots for dinner with my girlfriend. This particular establishment is the closest to our hometown and, therefore, one of the most frequented Olive Gardens we eat at. There is plenty of parking and the restaurant is always clean with a friendly staff ready to assist you. The food is great and there are tons of options, so even the picky eaters should find something they will enjoy. Our go-to appetizer is the 5 Cheese Fonduta...definitely a must try if you enjoy cheese and bread. I usually order the Chicken Parmigana or the Chicken Scampi. It is usually too much for me to finish in one sitting when combined with appetizers, bread sticks and salad, but always makes a good lunch the next day. My girlfriend really enjoys the fettuchine alfredo and the sangria. If you're looking for a dessert, definitely give the Dolcini's a try. They're delicious and small enough to enjoy no matter how stuffed you are.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,762 US-202

The manager asked me to hold on, disappeared for 10 minutes, and then came back with the discontinued dish!!! He had personally gone through the kitchen, found the ingredients, and put it together for me. It’s this kind of customer service that makes the difference.

After checking in to see what the hold up was, we were told they were just waiting for the server and she should be there any minute.   We were seated 45min after arriving and had to check with the hostess multiple times about being seated!! Lots of other people came in after and were seated with wait staff to take their order.  Eventually our server arrived and they left the poor girl to deal with 12 people by herself. They set her up for a rough service on volume alone. In the past the OG has had 2 servers to cover the group of 12.  We got drinks (fountain sodas, chocolate milk, and water) about 15min after being seated.  Most of the adults did the soup, salad, and breadsticks lunch so that was quick.  The kid food came 35min after the drinks!  The food was as good as any olive garden, but trying to keep 6 kids occupied in a small lobby for that long and then being slow with their orders didn't make for the best experience.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,762 US-202

Disgusting and disappointed that they didn’t asked him to put his feet down, I asked to be moved to another section, my guest couldn’t believe it. We were seated in another room, unfortunately the room was extremely hot and smell of rancid fat. They didn’t offer another area, so my guest and myself opted to leave.

30148,43,103,Italian,1,05/25/2022,My family and I were visiting from out of town and so excited to see a familiar restaurant.  Deciding on this place was an absolute bad idea. Our waiter seemed very nervous and we couldn't figure out why. He seemed to be in a great mood with everyone but us. We received our appetizers & bread with no plates. He even forgot our silverware at one point. The restaurant was not crowded so I'm not sure why the service we received was lacking. Another waiter sat a family near us and that family was swiftly moved. I We received a lot of stares and couldn't help but think it had to do with us being the only minorities in the room. It was just a very uncomfortable experience.  The food was also not the best. We all got white sauce with our pasta and it had a very yellow tint. The food was just not good.  This was a really disheartening experience as it put a damper on our image of the area.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,762 US-202
30149,44,103,Italian,5,09/27/2022,I know that Olive Garden gets a bad rap but we tend to like the restaurant especially this location.

My 6oz steak came burned to a crisp even though I order it to be cooked medium. The pasta was over cooked and overly salty. The Salad had alot of brown old lettuce in it. We all ended up not taking a chance on it and sent it back. The Manager did give me a refire on my stake and the 2nd time around it came out perfect. Long story short if you need a quick place to walk in and eat then it's for you, but for the price and the quality, there are better places to eat then here.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,762 US-202

When I brought the food home, I did not like what I saw. The salad quantity was half of what it used to be. I am disappointed in the server asking for a tip without fulfilling the order properly. Last time they did not prepare the salad box properly and now they served half the quantity. Disappointed.

30163,59,103,Italian,3,05/25/2022,Server was fantastic. But the food did not have the pizaz I was looking for. It was kind of bland. I do recommend you going there just make sure you order something with more flavor. Perhaps order the salad with the dressing on the side. That has way too much dressing.

30168,64,103,Italian,2,05/25/2022,"Food was good. Service was bad. Olive Garden should stop the unlimited soups/salads/breadsticks and simply charge for them, instead of humiliating customers. Asked for a soup refill, got it almost when I finished my main course, after almost 20 mins. Had to send it back, since I was already done with my meal. Place was empty. The waiter was waiting just one other table. Makes no sense why it would take 20 mins for a soup refill in an empty restaurant. Also the waiters attitude seemed like she was doing a favor by giving a refill. Left the restaurant with a bad taste — no pun intended.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,762 US-202

Their pasta is good but not as good as places who make fresh pasta from scratch on site. Their desserts are great I highly recommend the zeppoli with chocolate sauce and split with someone. Absolutely divine! The service at this location is good but not great. Tends to be slow. Today in particular our server was also covering the bar.

I brought my mother here for her birthday and order the salad and my mother wanted soup. Our waiter Jose informed me that I wouldn't get the normal bowl of salad that we usually got every visit, but instead a small bowl for one person. I had no idea they changed the amount of salad you get. I read it was unlimited. He was even rude about it. So we both settled for the soup. Then our. Main course came out. I ordered the shrimp scampi. The shrimp was way over cooked and the sauce had a funny after taste. My mother got the tour of Italy and her lasagna was super dry as if it had been sitting.  We informed our waiter but he just asked if we wanted a new order. By this time I was so disappointed and had somewhere else to be, we didn't have time to wait for them to remake everything.

Bartender takes my order comes back with no breadstcicks, so I ask her to bring them. She then disappears for at least 15 mins, and brings my food, of course I wanted a soup refill before the meal, so I asked her for refill. A guy brings the soup and says I only took one bite I promise. This seemed weired to me, I didn't eat the soup. Also was out of water, with no Bartender to be found, I left the money for my meal under my empty water glass and left. For having no other customers and being so unattended I couldn't leave a tip. She was in back most of the time, and didn't ask once if I needed anything else. It's a shame this place has gotten this way recently.

Let’s start with the salad. The dressing was not the usual one that was always top notch. This time it tasted like it had some type of different spices in it.....not good. Breadsticks delicious as usual. We both ordered the chicken Marsala that has a stuffing between the two pieces of chicken. Again some type of different spices. It may have been rosemary not really sure but it ruined the taste.  We were so disappointed. I hope it was a one time event but at this point I’m not sure if we will return to this location.

Decor is nicer than I recalled.    Waitress was very nice. She held our cake and served it after dinner course.    The only issue I had was with the order taking electronic device. My 3 year old added items to 'cart' which I removed. Apparently this orders the items. Waitress was understanding and removed them from our bill.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,762 US-202
30191,88,103,Italian,4,06/29/2022,Limited menu these days but they're still good old salad and bread sticks  However the chocolate brownie lasagna is worth the trip(definitely a dessert to share,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,762 US-202
30192,90,103,Italian,3,05/26/2018,Olive Garden is really nice but I rate this visit as 3 stars because of several lapses in the food quality and presentation. After a long day we went at about 8.15 PM last night. The wait staff were really nice and the people are good but here is what why we rate this visit 3 stars. 1) Took more than 15 minutes after the soup to get the breadsticks 2) The salad had a piece of the plastic salad bag in it 3) The minestrone soup was more a garden vegetable soup missing the beans and pasta when they first served it. The people were very nice and fixed the issues we noticed - but these basic quality checks did exist and can be prevented with a little more due diligence while plating.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,762 US-202
30193,91,103,Italian,5,05/26/2019,"Aaliyah was a fantastic waitress. This is proabably the best Olive Garden in New Jersey. It was very busy the night we went and our service and food was impeccable. The hostess accidentally sat us at a table meant for a larger party and because they had to move us the wonderful general manager provided us with a free dessert. You will not regret coming to this Olive Garden even if it’s a bit of a drive. We came all the way from Old Bridge after reading the rave reviews. Food is fantastic, service is wonderful, they handle a crowd very well, and the service is very fast. We will definitely be repeat customers.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,762 US-202
30194,93,103,Italian,5,05/26/2017,"First time ever to an Olive Garden.  Very pleasantly surprised.  Service was great.  Menu and wine selection very good.  Had the Chicken Piccata... very tasty. (didn't care for the Parmesan crusted zucchini, so they might want to work on another side)   Mini desserts are great and just enough to satisfy.  Salad/bread sticks very good.  Good quality and value for the money.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,762 US-202

Deborah is our favorite server but all your servers are very good and professional.  The food is very good and you get a lot of value for your money. In ten years of going here, you've had maybe 2 servers that were awful and they were gone quickly.  We love Olive Garden-Bridgewater and we would never think of forsaking our weekly jaunts!",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,762 US-202
30197,96,103,Italian,3,05/26/2019,"Olive Garden is always a very hit-or-miss proposition for me. I never know what to expect. Our waitress was good this time and the food was okay. I tried the chicken gnocchi soup a second time, hoping to find gnocchi in it this time. I found them, but they were mushy and gummy. Not very appealing. My pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was good, but they had only a very light sprinkling of finely-diced vegetables as my add-in, which was kind of annoying. We never order dessert so I can't speak to that.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,762 US-202
30198,97,103,Italian,5,05/26/2019,"Very prompt service, friendly and accommodating waiter. It was 4 adults and the food was very good and hot. Our waiter was attentive and very helpful!

30199,98,103,Italian,1,05/25/2021,"Went there tonight and was disappointed with the condition of the table. We were given a table that was dirty.  Smeared ketchup and crumbs? Especially now with the focus on sanitation,  this was very disappointing and doesn't give us confidence that proper safety measures are a priority to this restaurant. Also, the silverware wasn't properly cleaned.  Get it together Olive Garden!",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,762 US-202
30200,99,103,Italian,2,05/25/2021,"I hate having to leave this review, but I really feel people need to be warned.

Change is bad …",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,762 US-202
30201,100,103,Italian,2,05/25/2020,I don't know what came over me. I just suddenly decided that I should give Olive Garden another chance.    I regret this.    For the price the food is lacking. Everything tastes standard and beige. We left wanting. The waitress tried her best but it just doesn't make up for the microwaved/reheated TV dinners they are trying to pass off as restaurant fare.    If you value your taste buds or would like to stay awake through dinner I recommend skipping this and letting this fossil fade away.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,762 US-202
30202,101,103,Italian,4,05/26/2019,"Food was good. We were a family of 5. They made us sit on a table with another guest right behind us inspite of the fact that there were other empty places around. It was so inconvenient for us to even push the chair a little backwards to sit comfortably. The other guest would have also found it very difficult to get up and leave. We took the next neighboring table after requesting them. They agreed. But I feel they should have thought about this small customer experience factor a little before and not allocated a table just based on who was available to serve. After we moved to the next table, we requested specifically for the fork/spoons/tissues as they weren't done, as a part of the transfer. The person who served at the new table seemed to have no clue that these things haven't been placed for us and that we moved from another table. These things felt very robotic.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,762 US-202
30203,102,103,Italian,5,05/26/2018,"I have been coming to this location for several years and while the service and food has always been satisfactory, it has become absolutely exceptional in the last few months since the new General Manager, David started. David is always seen around the restaurant and makes each table feel welcomed with his personal greetings and attention to making sure all aspects of our meal are perfect. Everything about each recent experience at this Olive Garden has been wonderful from our friendly greeting at the door, to our drinks always being delicious and always getting refilled before they empty, and of course the food is delicious. Most recently our server Matty gave us a delightful time while dining with his warm personality and knowledge of the menu, even suggesting which wines would pair well with our entrees! Overall we never leave the Olive Garden in Bridgewater dissatisfied and cannot help but to continue coming back time and time again!",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,762 US-202
30204,103,103,Italian,5,05/26/2018,"I honestly can't say enough.  Outstanding all around.  I was late and didn't have my phone, so couldn't tell my party I was running late.  Hostess greeted me, and helped me find my table.  Dinner was on the table, but no drink, no biggie I was late.  Waiter was at my table in less than 5mins for drink order.  Waiter was super attentive and patient.  We left with 2 children under 9, doggie bags, and we were a mess.  Hostesses grabbed bags and threw our food in, made our lives easy.  I called General Manager and told him about my experience.  He said ""I wasn't even here last night."". That speaks volumes.  They were great, because they want to be!  Thank you for an outstanding experience.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,762 US-202

30206,105,103,Italian,5,05/26/2017,They consistently serve great food and not to mention love their breadstick & salad. Staff is always friendly and bar always does a good job with drinks. Highly recommend for happy hour or drinks. They have a nice little bar area that is good for small groups.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,762 US-202
30207,106,103,Italian,1,05/26/2019,"I have nothing nice to say about this restaurant chain, so I probably should not say anything at all. My family and I made a huge mistake eating here one night- not to the fault of management.  This restaurant chain barely sells real food.  The staff were pleasant but not above and beyond- if you enjoy Olive Garden I would recommend this particular location, but that's all.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,762 US-202

30209,108,103,Italian,5,05/26/2017,"Oh Olive Garden, Another chain restaurant with a penitent for making me drool.  I got some lovely pasta with meatballs, keeping it simple.  The waitress accidentally spilled some wine on my grandma, but we got most of our meal for free.  It really wasn't that bad and I hope that the waitress didn't get in too much trouble.  Our table was pretty crowded.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,762 US-202
30210,109,103,Italian,4,05/26/2019,"Anytime of the day that the Olive Garden is open it is typically crowded. I do know that the breadsticks and the over side salad or absolutely wonderful additions to have with your meal. They seem to now be creating these Mega meals combining a variety of dishes to satisfy the appetite of the diners. The bar area, if you want to go just for drinks, is well-stocked and you can get the drinks that you crave. All in all, not a bad dining experience for the price.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,762 US-202
30211,110,103,Italian,5,05/25/2020,Omg. As a visiting Aussie I had never experienced the Olive Garden before and wow! So much food! Even the breadticks were amazing and I loved the vodka sauce. The waitstaff were so friendly and despite being rushed off their feet the smile never left their faces and nothing was too much trouble for them. I am officially in love with Olive Garden!,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,762 US-202

30213,112,103,Italian,1,05/26/2018,I don't know why I went again last night. I was hopeful since the last time I was there and ordered eggplant parm that was terrible. This time we ordered fried zucchini. There were three slices on the place and it was raw with Parmesan cheese on it. We sent it back and they insisted we try the zucchini bites which were much better. I ordered the minestrone soup that was so bad I returned it (and they charged me). The salad was bland and I ordered more dressing. The bread is good. So I ate bread and salad for dinner and paid zucchini bites and paid $20. I will never ever go again,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,762 US-202

Apparently they have gone downhill since my last visit.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,762 US-202
30215,114,103,Italian,1,05/25/2020,"Very disappointing!  Went on a Sunday afternoon to celebrate a birthday.  Waited about 15 min. for someone to come to table.  Finally asked another server for help, she was rude.  Pushed the call button on the Ziosk, a young man came over and said since nobody else was around, he would take care of us.  He tried, but was very busy.  Drinks weren't refilled, food came out at different times.  Had to always flag him down if we needed something.  Table crowded and full of dishes, nobody took them away.  Check came, server didn't remember coupon from beginning and had trouble using gift card.  Very long wait.  Nothing special for birthday.  Sorry we chose the Olive Garden in Bridgewater.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,762 US-202

After pressing call server and waiting, we left cash on the table and left.  Never saw a staff member near our table until we were leaving - a hostess saying our table would be ready soon since we were leaving.   Pretty sad when the menus were still on the table!",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,762 US-202

30218,117,103,Italian,5,05/26/2019,"They still had the same overly-salted breadsticks and bland salad but the soup surprised me. This time, I ordered the chicken gnocchi soup and spaghetti with marinara and garden veggies. There was one gnocchi and two pieces of chicken in my bowl of soup. The broth and veggies were tasty but that's not good service. A friend later told me (without my even mentioning my experience) that she'd ordered the same soup and had no gnocchi at all. My pasta was cooked well and the veggies were good. There was very little sauce but what they had was also good. I just wish they were more consistent, which is what you would expect from a chain",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,762 US-202
30219,118,103,Italian,1,05/26/2018,"The food wasn't bad, the server was ok, a little forgetful; however the cockroach on our table at the end of our visit was not an invited guest of ours.

30220,119,103,Italian,1,05/26/2019,"I've been to Olive Gardens in Nashville (TN), Allentown (PA), and Scranton (PA), and this visit was without hesitation the worst. In general, Olive Garden provides a filling and quality dining experience at an affordable price.    Caveat: This terrible experience was all about service. The food was excellent from start to finish.    The Bridgewater Olive Garden is huge. It was busy when we arrived, a Saturday evening, but not at capacity. The host asked if we would be wiling to sit ""bar side"", which we were fine with. We ordered drinks and menu items, and received our salads all without issue.    After that, it fell apart. I ordered one from the Buy One, Take One menu. They delivered the wrong meal (one I asked for takeaway)--I know it was a mix-up, as I ordered the Pasta & Broccoli at an upcharge which you can't takeaway. These things happen--no big deal. I asked them to box that one and I'd take the original dish.    Then...nothing. Our server just disappeared. She was tending the bar as well for a period, but after about 5 minutes the bar emptied out. We never saw her again. After approximately 20 minutes (not exaggerating--the rest of the table had finished their meals), a manager-looking man asked how the meal was. I explained the situation, and he said he would check.    He came back and said that he would have my new order made right away...which means that the server never even communicated the mix-up to the chefs. 20 or so minutes later, i received my dish. I had to flag down the manager and ask for a refill on my dish, which was uncomfortable. So i ate my dinner an hour behind schedule while the rest of the party awkwardly watched. We were in the middle of a road trip, so this pushed back our arrival significantly.    It's very important to note that I was calm and flexible throughout the entire ordeal. Working the service industry is difficult and draining, and I've witnessed first hand how terrible guests can be. I did not do that, and yet I still got nowhere.    Fed up, we paid via the kiosk and left. All I got was a half-hearted ""sorry about that"" from the manager on shift as we walked out.    You work hard for your money and most of us don't get enough of it. Be sure to spend it elsewhere.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,762 US-202
30221,120,103,Italian,1,05/25/2021,"Terrible experience with to go order yesterday.. First, it was delayed by 15 mins from the time I was asked to come. That’s okay but once we opened the food at home, what did we find? Stale breadsticks with visible mold!!! Can you believe this? They served food that is stale and with mold! Totally unacceptable service",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,762 US-202
30222,121,103,Italian,1,05/25/2020,"Today was an absolute waste of my time. From the moment I walked in at lunch I waited 10 minutes for someone just to greet me, there was maybe 5 tables seated 2 hosts on duty which no one was there. My server took 15 MINUTES just to come over ask me if I wanted a drink. Got my soup was cold, but the server never came back to check on me to see how everything was. At the end my daughter wanted dessert so we waited and waited and waited for the waitress to come see if we were done or how things were she never did. So we put a dessert in on the iPad we waited 25 MINUTES for a dessert, the server FINALLY came over 25 minutes later and I told her to cancel it that dessert shouldn’t take that long. She told me I Should have told her I wanted dessert and not put it in the iPad .. didn’t even apologize !! Shame on you and your serving!!",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,762 US-202

I was told that they are cleaning them for us (as if they just have those 2 plates remaining in the entire restaurant) took 10 minutes and still didn't give us plates and food was running cold on the table. Moreover didn't even ask for water nor served us cheese over salad. He made it seem as if it was our mistake that we got those dirty plates and didn't want us to say anything about it.

30226,125,103,Italian,1,05/26/2017,"Went with the family for dinner on March 18th 2017, the service deteriorated to such an extent, I probably should think multiple times before even thinking on going again to this place.  The food quality has degraded the quality of service and hospitality has literally vanished. Well here are the scenario of events that occurred to us the moment we walked into the restaurant.  Entered into the restaurant and it almost took more 10 mins for the front staff to greet us and they never took our names and after a while (about 15+ minutes kater) we were called as part of 4.  Then we settled in our booth and the waiter did not care to introduce himself and asked for our orders as if he was in a hurry. We gave him our order and he got the appetizers, soup and salad after about 20 minutes and never cared about asking to top cheese on our food he delivered or asking us If we needed anything more.  Then he brought our dinner and one of the dish was burnt and we had to send it back and had to wait for an extended time to get our food. In the meanwhile the manager and the staff were watching our situation and they never bothered to come and ask us about the service or tried to make us feel comfortable.  As soon as we finished our main course, the waiter slammed the check on our table; we were never asked or given the opportunity for the desert. We then walked out of the door and there was no hospitality or courtesy of the staff from the time we entered to the time we exited out of the restaurant.  It is very Painful to say the restaurant w always go, has changed drastically for the worse, forcing us to make a decision to may not go again.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,762 US-202

The restaurant’s policy seems to be first come first serve. Instead try Ruby Tuesdays right across the street. They were able to seat and serve a party of 18 instantly, without notice.

I got the Ravioli di Portobello and my girlfriend got the Stuffed Chicken Marsala. Good sized portions and we thought the food was nice, but not worth writing home about. It took a while for our food to come out, but was understandable because the restaurant was absolutely packed.    This may be an old thing now, but I haven't been to an Olive Garden in a while and one thing that surprised me was the tablet on the table. You could order drinks, appetizers, and dessert as well as play games ($1.99 for unlimited play) and pay your bill on it. It made it easy to swipe the credit card and leave when our meal was finished which was nice, but I still don't know how I feel about having a tablet to play games on at a restaurant table, even if it is for kids.

The waitstaff acts as though you are putting them out by ordering and waiting an hour for your food that arrives cold and tastes like someone had no clue how to cook. It was nasty food, served by a nasty waitress. Management offered desert when we bought it to his attention, we did not accept it. We paid full price for our check, at the register the manager again offered to take 5% off our check, I explained that I did not want a discount, I just wanted out of their establishment! I left no tip for the rude waitress, who at the check out computer told me the only reason I was upset was to get a discount. There are so many nice neighborhood restraunts who really are family ran with family recipes. Why go here to be treated like you have intrupted them asking for a napkin and fork? Go anywhere else, i will never eat at an olive garden again, too many other choices out there than be be exposed to such hatefullness!  1.) Horrible wait staff  2.) Horrible cooks  3.)

But I went to lunch there with work friends and had a delicious low-carb meal. My friends both took advantage of the endless pasta bowl special, which looked very appealing and which they ate with gusto. I had chicken piccata accompanied by zucchini slices with parmesan topping. Our server was very attentive and friendly, and the food came quickly.  The Bridgewater/Raritan location is nicely laid out and decorated. Our booth was very comfortable and conducive to leisurely conversation over the meal. Menu items I would love to try: Chocolate Brownie Lasagna and a non-alcoholic beverage called Lemonata  (or something like that).",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,762 US-202

30279,179,103,Italian,2,05/26/2017,"Shouldn't Italian food have flavor? Olive Garden really has gone downhill.    The salad was the highlight of the meal.    The chicken and shrimp carbonara had next to no flavor at all. I felt like I was eating spaghetti in butter. The chicken itself was very tender but aside from a slight chard taste was bland same goes for the shrimp.  My girlfriend ordered the rosemary garlic chicken with mashed potatoes and spinach. The only thing rosemary about the dish was the rosemary garnish. The chicken itself was boarder line flavorless. The sides that accompanied it were very small the spinach was nothing more than a few uncooked spinach leaves and a small scoop of potatoes.    Overall very disappointed in the meal especially at the price. I feel as if I could get better ""Italian food"" from Applebee's, Ruby Tuesday's or any other average chain. We didn't even bother to finish our meals.    This more than likely will be our last visit to Olive Garden.

One of the parties was for what looked like a 13 yr old female with friends. They couldn't sit down for more than five minutes without a group of them getting up to go to restroom and of course walking past our table and knocking into the table. Parents were oblivious.

The store attached to them sells every Italian pasta, cured meat and dessert you could imagine.    The calamari was massive and tender, the tomato sauce was a bit acidic.

They messed up our reservation, and when the hostess (who was awesome), the server gave her a hard time and was beyond rude.  It took them almost an hour to take our appetizer order and deliver the apps.  No one checked on us to see if we were happy with our food.  I sat with a stack of dirty plates in front of me for about 20  minutes...they were cleated right before our entrees came out.  I know what some might think..that they were understaffed, but they had plenty of people on...just no one was paying any attention to us.  The food was lack luster...at least mine was....flounder francias....barely any flavor.  We got our bill....gave them our card...waited about 20 minutes for it to be returned...and member of our party went to the bathroom....the server was inside..handed him our bill and said here ya go.    When we first started going...the staff was much friendlier...and the food was much better.  It seems like they just don't care anymore.

To his credit, our waiter who was clearly frustrated and overwhelmed, never took this out on the customers.  Kudos to him and his professionalism.  Still, it was a  2 1/2 hour dinner which was frustrating to us as customers given that we really didn't have that kind of time to spend. Hopefully this was just a one time thing.

30973,37,107,Italian,2,05/25/2022,This joint was this week’s date night pick. The sexier half and I put a bunch of restaurants into a cup and blind pick a spot for our weekly date night .    We have a reservation for 6 pm and as we are walking up and in the door the place is EMPTY … uh oh but it’s early so we will see. Sit down order some fried calamari in spicy marinara app a small 2 glass bottle of wine ( no bar) and our dinners . I had mine down to 2 selections so I let the waiter advise and he proclaims the linguini marechiaro  ( mixed seafood) as their signature dish so I go with that.the woman goes with shrimp fra diavlo over pasta.    Calamari is an unremarkable standard rings and mini whole squids tentacles and all and is on the greasier side of appetizing . The spicy marinara  is the standard marinara with 2-3 shakes of red pepper flake on top. If you gonna put 2 sauce selections on the menu … have two legitimate sauces .    On to entrees food comes out warm not hot the signature dish was fair to ok at best and the shrimp fra diavlo was absent of any spice whatsoever .    I certainly do not understand the overall 4.2 rating of this place as I probably wouldn’t return other than I now want to try the other of my selections Chicken Benny.    When Olive Garden can offer you competition as far as flavor and quality in the Italian restaurant theater you have work to do.    Hal gives a so-so at best,Ciao Bello Restaurants,220 S Ave E

We eventually had to flag down the hostess and tell her our situation. Once a waiter was assigned to our table, the service felt rushed and unfriendly. The quality of food certainly did not match the prices of the entrees. While our appetizers were fairly tasty, the entrees were mediocre. My meal was around $18.00 and yet my entree tasted like it was prepared by an amateur cook. The tomato sauce was clearly not authentic and the pasta was a bit too firm to eat. The pizza tasted like a generic store-bought frozen pizza pie. The only reason I ate the entirety of my meal was that the bill was so pricey. If you are looking for authentic Italian food and friendly service, this place will disappoint.",Ciao Bello Restaurants,220 S Ave E

I certainly do not blame the waiters & waitresses. The inside of the restaurant was also very warm on Father's Day. Our waiter advised that the AC was on it's highest level. Ciao Bello's menu also needs a major upgrade. The main menu has not changed, to my knowledge and experiences, since they opened. The are daily specials offered but the overall experience is sameness year after year...I also do not recall the owners of Ciao Bello coming over to our table during my recent visits either...",Ciao Bello Restaurants,220 S Ave E

I guess they are using better cheese; not the typical restaurant depot cheese. The other 3 visits were with fish, soup salad and desert. It was one of the best of each from my past experience. I would say much better than I would expect with this price range. Outdoor seating is a nice experience if the weather is good. Nothing disappointing in my experience.

My wife and I both said at the same time we’re not ordering from here again. A lot of better pizza places around. They earned the star I gave them because the white pie was edible.

The food was pricey and awful. The salad tasted like cole slaw in vinegar and the pizza was actually disgusting. The crust was hard as a rock. One of my friends said something to our waiter who explained that the type of pizza we ordered is pre-made. That explains it! I've had better frozen pizza from the supermarket.

Ordered take out- Food was cold (I live less than a mile from the restaurant) Received a call that the desserts I ordered online were unavailable. Order was already placed so I was forced to pick between dessert choices I didn't care for. I requested strawberries onside as it came with the initial dessert and was told over the phone I would have it with my order, I did not.    ""Crab cakes"" were 70% filling, french fries were soggy, mozzarella sticks soggy and grossly oily, chicken strips over cooked.    I called to have the issues corrected and was told they were ""too busy"" to deal with my order. Then to add insult to injury suggested that I pay for the items to be delivered that should've come complimentary that was already discussed (the initial dessert requested came with strawberries I asked to still have the strawberries with the substitute dessert and alfredo sauce in place of marinara for another order) Granted it's mother's day however, I'm still a paying customer like everyone else and was treated with rude, condescending, horrible customer service. As a former hospitality industry employee- this is simply unacceptable.    I've ordered from this restaurant once before and received burnt pizza and didn't complain as I'm relatively easygoing... I picked off the burnt areas and ate the pizza without complaints.    So disappointed. Will never order from them again!    There are better restaurants nearby.",Ciao Bello Restaurants,220 S Ave E

Prime example of why you shouldn't have teenagers working in what's otherwise shown as a nice restaurant.    The one star is simply because you serve food during the pandemic. I don't know how you expect to stay open during said pandemic when you turn away customers 2 hours before closing.    Unfortunate, a disgrace to the service industry.    **Update**    Revisited this place with my girlfriend after Benny reached out to me on Instagram. We returned during the busy mother's day weekend and while I didn't get the chance to see Benny due to how busy it was. We were served some incredible food with some nice service to match!    I've since updated my review to 4 stars as Benny sincerely apologized to me on behalf of his restaurant and staff. He's a guy who really cares about his business and puts that care into the quality of his food. While it is unfortunate that all of these places may have a bad apple here and there, I gotta give credit where it's due. Message me to come back and then bring me out some delicious food? You're obviously serious and deserve the second chance!    I went from someone who wouldn't bother wasting my time here ever again to someone who wouldn't mind coming back and that's how you take care of business.

We flagged down our hostess to let her know. I would say our appetizers were good & entrees were just okay. Our waiter never came to the table to fill out water or ask how our dinner was.

30994,58,107,Italian,2,05/26/2017,"I want to share  my ""not so great"" experience at Ciao Bello in Cranford last night. We arrived at 6:00 & were told we would have a very long wait due to people with reservations for 7:00. First of all, that was not for another hour and one would think a restaurant would leave a FEW tables open for people who didn't have reservations.  We were then told there was a two-person table but that it was sort of ""crammed in"". That was putting it mildly; there was literally a 1/2"" between that table and the surrounding tables!! So when we looked at them like they were crazy they said they would move the table out for us, which they did... practically in the isle! We were hungry so we decided to make the best of it even though  we felt like we were ""on display"". (Way too many tables in a restaurant that size). While we were waiting for our meal, other patrons arrived & instead of waiting in the designated area they were crammed into the restaurant practically on top of us, making us feel very uncomfortable. The Hostess should have politely told  them to move to the waiting  area, despite us mentioning it twice. Next, the meal. The bread, although soft on the inside had a crust that would break your teeth. Our meals, although very tasty were a little over cooked. We were told that because of our inconvenience they would give us a discount on our meals but when the check came we were told that our deserts were on them. We weren't going to have dessert and it was not what we were originally told but we figured we would take it. When we looked at our bill they had only given us ONE free dessert. We didn't say anything and got our desserts to go. When we got home, well let's just say, we were very surprised. We had gotten a piece of carrot cake which was literally a ""sliver"" of a piece, certainly not worth $8 & a piece of cheesecake which was a small square, as if they cut the front piece off and just gave us the back end. I was very surprised at the whole evening due to the fact that the two other times I had been there it was not like this.  Sorry Ciao Bello but last night's experience only gives you 2 stars..""**""",Ciao Bello Restaurants,220 S Ave E

Food arrived at just before midnight. Supervisor that is on today said that I should have known that based on my location it would take an hour. Yes I was quoted that on seamless!

The third time I called back he told me they were extremely busy and was sorry and continued to hang up the phone on me. All I wanted at that point was to have my money returned to me for the missing meal but Benny was unwilling to help in any way possible. I will never go to this place ever again or order food from them. The lack of respect for customers is absurd. We spent 65+ dollars on food and only received half of it.

My favorite dish is the penne vodka which surpass the same offered by Ferrara's in Westfield. And each new dish I try everytime I go to Ciao Bello is a positive surprise... The food is carved with supreme taste and great presentation, and surprisingly fast delivered. Highly recommended. I specially love to go there and stay outdoors in the Summer, with some wine. No mosquitos bugging me when I'm there in Summer time.",Ciao Bello Restaurants,220 S Ave E
31020,84,107,Italian,5,05/25/2020,"Ciao Bello has never disappointed me, and they weren't about to start either. Welcoming ambiance. Great and friendly staff. Delicious, finger licking food, yes, I did lick my fingers as I was scraping the last bit of their most delicious desserts Granted, I always take food home, as I like to share my culinary experiences with my walk on 4 children  and keep my trim figure in line, lol.  Back to what matters:  Their filet mignon is always on point (medium-rare, I mean is there any other way to eat filet mignon, the answer is no, lol), and their sides are just always delicious. I am showing my mom the great places that Cranford has to offer, and Ciao Bello is definitely one of Cranford's finest.",Ciao Bello Restaurants,220 S Ave E

They cook more healthier food then surrounding pizzerias, but it also more pricey- usually cost me $15-20 per my salad and soup  Also 4 stars- because it happens they mess up with the delivery- like wrong dressing or missing item, but I was working in place like this and understand it might happen to everybody",Ciao Bello Restaurants,220 S Ave E

31033,98,107,Italian,3,05/26/2017,I picked up the Chicken Parmesan with a side salad and was a little disappointed to see only 1 chicken breast.

They brought out a garden salad to start which was fresh with great olives and dressing, we ordered the Italy trio came with lasagna, chicken parmigiana & fettuccine, the lasagna was so good. We also ordered the warm zeppoles which were delicious with warm strawberry and chocolate dip.  The service was excellent.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center
31403,1,109,Italian,5,05/25/2022,"We dropped in for late lunch. The menu is limited but the prices are good and portion size was sufficient, especially Soup, Salad, and Bread Sticks.

31404,2,109,Italian,4,11/26/2022,"The salad  and bread sticks are delicious, the pasta of any kind is delightful. It has super good desserts and the service is good. Also keep in mind to get there before  to get the table depending in what time you want to have dinner ( I suggest 20-30 minutes), or call to make a reservation.  Overall food and service is good  . The kids love it",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center
31405,3,109,Italian,4,08/28/2022,Visit this place at least once a month for lunch. Always have had good service and food. Love the pasta fagiola soup and salad. Usually opt for one of the duo lunch specials which range in price from $7.99 - $9.99 Nice selection of pastas and other Italian dishes to pair with either the soup or salad. Always have great service in the bar area. Good value eating in a decent environment.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center

31408,6,109,Italian,1,02/24/2023,"This has been the place where I enjoy to go with friends and family. But this time was a disappointment. The food and service was okay but the main reason we came was to celebrate someone’s birthday and they didn’t have enough desserts on Friday… a start of a weekend… after being told they didn’t have any dessert, but the cheesecake, their staff comes out singing to another table that came after us with not one but 2 of the desserts we wanted. Their staff didn’t even try to find a solution for us, they just said sorry we don’t any other deserts options available. People come to this place to celebrate a birthday or anything, but without dessert options to select, says a lot. Management should plan ahead for busy days like Fridays. Now we know to think twice before choosing this restaurant.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center
31409,7,109,Italian,5,01/25/2023,Celebrated my sons birthday and came here for dinner And so glad I did!!!!! Our waiter George went above and beyond anything I had ever seen.

Because of Infinity, we will continue to return.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center
31413,11,109,Italian,2,03/26/2023,"The staff do a wonderful job to work around the busy and loud environment it always seems to have. They are attentive and excellent at knowing when they are needed. The food is heavy on the butter and cream, but lacking in seasoning which makes the overall experience of any pasta dish rather dissapointing. The proteins, whether it be chicken or shrimp (I only experienced these two in two separate entrees) are just meh, edible but not enjoyable. The bread sticks tasted extremely yeast-y and were the definitely not the same quality I once had years ago here.  If you want Italian, go literally anywhere but here.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center
31414,12,109,Italian,3,02/24/2023,"The food at Olive Garden is absolutely delicious, but when I went on Friday, I had a problem with paying with my credit card through the machine.

31415,13,109,Italian,4,04/25/2023,My experience at this Olive Garden was pretty good. I love the breadsticks and there salads. I also got the spaghetti and meatballs it was average but the salad and breadsticks were enough to make up for it. The vibe inside is warm and my server was friendly although was not very attentive. The prices are average and my experience was alright.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center
31416,14,109,Italian,4,02/24/2023,"Everything was good for the most part aside from the lack of croutons in the salad  no biggie for me but my wife was a lil bothered that there wasn't a single 1 to be found in the salad.

31417,15,109,Italian,5,05/25/2020,"It was the waitress, Dory that make it great. She was helpful and go beyond her required services. The food was delicious too. My friend had the unlimited soup and salad and I had the unlimited pasta. Each one was just as fresh and delicious as the other. On the pasta, you get the choose what type plays, then the sauce, and if you want topping, such as chicken, sausage or shrimp. You paid the first topping then after that you don't need to pay additional money. Good varieties to choose from. Good value for your money.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center
31418,16,109,Italian,1,04/25/2023,I went with my family and they took 2 hours to get us our table then I ordered my food and it took at least 30 minutes to come then my dad would order a drink and they would give it to Him  10 minutes later he ordered it. After our food came and I was going to take the first bit in and I saw 6 pieces of long black hair  then after my mom saw 1 piece of short blonde hair in her pasta. I also want to say that when I ordered my coke I asked for no ice and it came with ice and the plates were dirty and forks still had food on it. NEVER GOING THERE AGAIN AND DO NOT GO THERE!!!,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center
31419,17,109,Italian,4,02/24/2023,"The Olive Garden Italian Restaurant experience across many restaurants keeps us coming back.  Bread sticks!!!!  We went on the busy Saturday night before Valentine's.    Our host walked us to a table but somehow didn't notice (or care) that the table had not been cleaned.    The food was great.  Managing a busy restaurant is challenging.  One hopes staff treatment and training improve to provide a five star experience.

The rest of the food was fine, I kind of wished that there were more interesting choices. It was probably the same menu since the last time I was there. All in all I didn't have to wait long to get a table for our family of 6 and we enjoyed out time there.

31427,25,109,Italian,4,05/26/2019,"We came for a Sunday lunch and were seated reasonably fast by a host who made sure someone was assigned to our table and that we were properly served. We had a good meal because we chose things we knew they could make well and which were worth getting at Olive Garden.    We ordered the braised beef and the lasagna. Many of the entrees are good but not really good value for the money but these two are. Read through the menu and pick something you will enjoy, but which would not be easy for you to make at home by boiling some macaroni and pouring a sauce on it that you can buy in any decent grocery store.    Olive Garden's real business is buying inexpensive wines and selling them to you for $8 or so per glass.  If that's what you really want, then go for it, but the soft drinks, beers, and cocktails may provide you better value.    If you go on a weekend you will have a better time if you go at lunch time or for an early dinner. The staff is friendly and helpful but only human and when you go when the place isn't full to overflowing they will be able to be at their best.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center

Over the time, we had mixed experience of both good and bad. But nothing beats their salad and bread, I love it. Their entrees are really large portion.

31431,29,109,Italian,1,05/25/2022,"I ordered a family meal. Chicken Parm, salad, and avocado dip. The chicken every piece was burnt. The bread sticks were loose at the bottom of the bag. The marinara sauce was in a big white bucket containing less than a quarter of sauce; the dip was not enough for 1 person. The chips were burnt also. I will not be a patron of this location. I paid around  $100 and had to throw in garbage. I ordered food from another establishment, Magiamo's and the food was Terrific.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center

Super good but honestly the soup and bread stick refills are so plentiful that you will have plenty of the main course left over to take home.

How hard is it to WRITE DOWN a persons order and repeat it to them so there won't be any mistakes?? I put this to mangement a few months ago yet the waiters still aren't doing it. Going to give it a few more tries but if this keeps going on then I'll tke my business elsewhere. It's not rocket science for gods sake.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center

31440,38,109,Italian,4,01/25/2023,The food was good and portions were generous. Our server kept our drinks. Salad and breadsticks refilled without being asked.  Only downside was that our entrees took a VERY long time to be served.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center

Our waitress was nice and sweet and food was quickly served but only giving 4 stars because we had to wait an 1 hour and 30 minutes even though we made a reservation online!!!!!

Also the breadsticks are unlimited which is great!!!,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center

31451,49,109,Italian,3,05/26/2019,"We had to ask for a different table because they tried seating my family and I in the back room because the main dining room was closed. The back room is cold and next to the bathroom. So you can smell a little bit of that ""bathroom"" smell. Our server was great. And the food came out fast and on time.  I ordered the ""All you can eat pasta"" with mixed veggies and marinara sauce. The veggies tasted like a microwavable bag of veggies so i wouldnt reccomend it at all. However, the marinara sauce was amazing.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center
31452,50,109,Italian,1,05/25/2020,"Was served raw shrimp which was incredibly fishy and the whole pasta dish tasted completely off. Sent back and it was taken off our bill but not a single apology was given from anyone at that location. Fell ill that night with symptoms of food poisoning. Wrote to corporate and was connected to the manager from the restaurant. Again, instead of an apology on behalf of her team, I was given a phone number and advised to RECONTACT HER to ""fix any issues"". Corporate office sent me a giftcard and called it a day. Is an APOLOGY that difficult and too much to ask for? I NEVER ASKED FOR A FREE MEAL OR A GIFTCARD. If that was my intention, I could've gotten that at the time of our visit. So thanks, but no thanks. Very disappointing customer service from both this location and Olive Garden corporate.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center

Super attentive, patient and awesome personality.. However when we returned a week later for my son's bday, the server we got this time was quite annoying.. She kept calling everyone and I mean EVERYONE ""my love"" which I found inappropriate.. I even saw her tending to another table with her mouth full, and she proceeded to clean her mouth with her bare hand as she walked away.. I only prayed she washed her hands before touching anyone else's food or ours.. Management needs to speak with her.. I would return, but crossing my fingers not to get her again bc I just might leave..",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center
31466,65,109,Italian,5,05/25/2022,Overall great food and dining experience. The front staff kind off scares and turn people away by telling them that there is a 1 hour wait time.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center
31467,66,109,Italian,1,10/27/2022,"Today, I am very disappointed with the service.  Put in a online order, only to show up and have a someone call on behalf of the store manager to say that it will take another hour. Keep in mind it was out in an hour ago. They called me 10 mins before I was supposed to pick it up and say another hour. So disappointed that the manager didn’t the leadership skills to call him/her self to tell me. Instead had a regular employee call.  Poor leadership quality.  I will not place another catering order with this location.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center
31468,67,109,Italian,5,05/26/2019,"I really reccomend it to you. The food here is just amazing! They have great appetizers before you start your meal. The appetizer I like best is mozzerela sticks. They are super cheesy! But, all appetizers are great! Something else they give you before you start the meal is yummy salad and warm, just out of the oven breadsticks. I love the breadsticks! The salad and breadsticks are free and you can have as many breadsticks you want. They are all a super delicious way to start the meal. They have alot of pastas to choose from. Not only pasta but there is soo much Italian food to choose from. It's delicious and fresh. If the waiters get alot of things wrong they give you free stuff but it only happens for new waiters and they don't make problems very often. After that delicious meal, top it all off with yummy dessert. They have different kinds of dessert. Some are super sweet most are not and they are so good. Most are dessers that stay around all year but they have some seasonal desserts. I love when they have apple pie in fall. I really reccomend this place to you.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center

The waiter was not professional and looked like she did not want to be there...service was horrible. The food was okay, bread sticks which are our favorite were not soft and moist, they were more on the hard side. I mean what a let down. Going out for a birthday dinner and leaving with a bitter taste. I would never go back to this Olive Garden with my family probably another location that I'm not sure of. Dinner was good but some was burnt and just plain overdone. We left in a hurry because it was a horrible service experience.

31478,77,109,Italian,1,05/25/2020,One of my favorite places to eat. It's so disappointing when you are hungry and your food comes raw. One chicken is over cooked on the tour and the other one is raw.

We had to send back several drinks and 1 appetizer to be redone. The kicker is: when they brought out the soups and salads, they also brought out our main dishes!!! NOT GOOD!! When we complained to them they said no problem, we'll leave it here and when you're ready for it, we'll give it to you.

Besides, the drinks were horrendous, my husband ordered an Amaretto and it was more water than the actual Amaretto, that was a nightmare. The waiter who served us offered us extra cheese several times but never brought it to the table, there was not enough bread. When we paid that we are leaving, l asked him for a order to go that we had ordedered in advance it was not ready and the kichen was closed.

Our waitress both times were good but all other services including seating, cooks and talking to the manager not as pleasent. I am pregnant and asked to sit in a both area or half booth and half table. I was told they didn't have a server for that area. Less than five feet from me. No more than ten minutes later they seated people in that section. They were busy and it took a while to get our drinks and then our salad, bread sticks and soups. Chalk it up to them being busy... Still not great.  We took my son for his birthday. So after the food came out we asked to talk to a manager. My mother in law and I both got sick having the chicken marsala. It was filled with salt. Talked to the manager because it was so terrible. She tried to blame the waitress! The waitress was fine and I insisted on keeping the waitress. She was the best part of the trip there and tried to make everything good despite issues. Well she told us she would remake the food and They remade it the ""old"" way as the manager said it and it was still terrible and salty. After everything was settled we headed home. Sadly, my mother in law and I are both very sick. My husband said his wasn't great either. My son was the only one who had a decent meal. Such a huge disappointment.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center

31527,127,109,Italian,3,05/25/2022,"I planned ahead and decided to order a bit of food for a family get together on New Years Eve.  I'm from out of town and decided to order from here about 3-4 hours in advance. My office usually orders a half tray of fettuccine alfredo, a lasagna, and a catering sized (half gallon) soup and knew that 4 hours was enough advanced notice (at least at the locations in my area).  I scheduled the pickup for 5 pm. I arrived just before 5 and was told that my order would be ready in 'just a few minutes'. I was first told that they're just finishing everything up and getting it ready. 30 minutes later, I was still waiting for them to finish the order with no real update. I was then told that they are still cooking the soup and it should be soon...  I was there until 6 pm, over an hour later than scheduled.  The food was good and gets 5 stars in my book, but the inconvenience of waiting an hour for a pre-ordered meal loses stars... 4 hours was a decent amount of notice for a relatively small order that they offer as a family bundle on their app. They should put a general notice of how much advanced notice is needed for these items.  They got an extra star for an apology and gift card to come back, but the entire situation seemed subpar compared to the locations in my area.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center

The vibes he gave were to keep a customer for life. He made it right and made me feel like I mattered in one of the times I needed it most (my husband recently had surgery and we were dealing with that).

After waiting for an hour to get to my table, the waitress couldn't tell me what sides were available and I wasn't even given a menu. When I finally ordered, they didn't have any croutons for the salad and they didn't have any more of the chicken gnocchi soup.

Plus their bathrooms are clean, which is a huge Plus!    The waitresses are always buzzing about refilling drinks and continually refilling water way before you drink it to the last drop.

It's a seafood place as soon as you go in its smell like the the sea. Lemon is the best to cut that smell they need to use a lot of it on their seafood, if not ask for lemon. Another thing they don't have a lot of options on the menu introduce more dishes on your menu.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center

31585,187,109,Italian,5,05/25/2021,Olive garden is very clean. They really kept covid19 rules. Our table was far enough from the other tables.  Our food arrived in a reasonable time.

31586,188,109,Italian,1,05/25/2022,"We ordered delivery Sat for next day Mother's Day.  As of now 70 minutes late and the restaurant just says she left with 15 orders and not when she will get here.  3 weeks ago we did pickup.  Worst overcooked hard bread sticks ever.  Avoid Paramus.    1 year later, gave them 3 chances. Dining room 25 percent full yet 45 minute wait.  Try hiring people to work. Bahamas Breeze next door alot faster.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center
31587,189,109,Italian,1,05/26/2018,I never really liked olive garden. Its knock off italian food. My 1st experience was horrible and told myself I would never go back. However we found ourselves going back for lunch the other day. We arrived before lunch time was over and ordered from the lunch menu. However our waiter didn't put in the order until a few minutes later after lunch was over. When we got our  check we realized that we were charged full price for items and not lunch menu prices (almost double).  The waiter kept telling us that we were not there in time for lunch.  We repeatedly explained to him that we were and that it wasn't our fault that our orders were not put in until after their lunch time was over. Apparently after a certain time which I believe is 2:00 p.m. their computer switches over and they are not able to enter lunch menu items. At the end it was resolved and we only paid lunch menu prices however the hassle was not worth it.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center

31589,191,109,Italian,3,05/25/2020,Ate here last night with a party of 5. Food was good but the service was sooooooooo slow. It took the waiter almost 10 minutes to bring out our drinks initially. What was intended to be a quick dinner ended up being almost 90+ minutes.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center

Sure someoneso the wait can be longer depending on how busy it is, but it's worth the wait. Also if you're old enough their mixed and other drinks are made very well. I would recommend you try this place at least once! You won't be sorry and it'll make for a wonderful time!

31594,196,109,Italian,1,05/27/2014,"I really dislike writing bad reviews but this one will be an exception! Upon arriving a 40+ minute wait, the line was out the door in less than 20 degree weather and I have a 2 month old baby. After being seated it took over 30 minutes to place the order for drinks. When the drinks were given there was one straw for 3 people to share and the one straw was soaking wet with an unknown substance. Then the proper menus were not placed on the table. We were given outdated menus which had several entrees that were no longer being served. The drinks were not consistently made one tea was peach and the other was bright pink. Moreover, we were not offered a choice of soup or salad and every-ones entree had a discrepancy ( my fettuccine Alfredo had very little sauce, moms had too much sauce and undercooked scallops, dad had burned stake). The waitress did not even ask if we wanted cheese on our salad or entrees. To add insult to injury, we had a coupon and the lady did not take it off the bill. I've been to over 100 Olive Gardens so far and never received this horrible customer service. I will NEVER come back here again until there is a change. I am very disappointed.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center

I had to get the manager to get us breadsticks and salad.  To add injury to insult, our appetizers, salad and food all came out within 1 min of each other. We had to very one kids but that didnt matter to the staff. The manager never came back to ask us if everything was ok. And after that point the waitress had an attitude,  like we did something wrong. All we wanted was food and drinks.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center
31596,198,109,Italian,5,05/26/2019,We have always had good service here.

Finally got salad another 16 minutes later, was told that there weren't any crutons, they were all out.  Tried ordering a lemonade, no lemonade either.  Ordered mozzarella sticks and  GUESS WHAT?!  NO MOZZARELLA STICKS EITHER!  slow service inbetween and when trying to get boxes to wrap up good.  Only redeeming aspect of the night was that our entrees were good.  Can't imagine how so many items can be out of stock on a Monday.  Service was also poor, wasn't that busy.  We used to enjoy going but after this experience, wouldn't rush back.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center
31599,201,109,Italian,4,05/26/2019,"Food was good, but service not so good. We waited a long time for our food to arrive, and when pasta takes long that's not good. Also the waiters are not as attentive as they should be with empty plates or asking you for bread or salad refill. I know the food taste is important but also the quality of service should be equal.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center

The food is typical olive garden fare, and consistent quality. Although it doesn't compare to a true Italian restaurant, it is still very good. I love that you can have all you can eat salad and soup. Salad is crisp and had just the right amount of dressing, not overflowing. They also have new dishes. I love the new salmon dish. Salmon was grilled perfectly and very tasty.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center

I honestly had a great experience with Olive Garden. The food doesn't take them that long to prepare if you're patient, and they occupy the time with free unlimited breadsticks and salad, which I thought was neat. The only problem I would have would be the long wait times (occasionally, not every day), and the Fettuccine in my Chicken Alfredo was slightly undercooked in some areas.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center
31604,206,109,Italian,4,05/26/2019,"The food is amazing. Put less salt on the bread. The service was better this time around. I had  a server named Crystal, she was an absolute delight.

Never ever again! Horrible service we waited half an hour for our food, our steaks were like dry shoe leather the fettuccine Alfredo was equally as dry and tasteless . Our food was cold. The bathrooms were disgusting, if my granddaughter didn’t have to go so badly, I never would have walked in there. Tried to call the manager after I got home waited on the phone for 15 minutes he never came to the phone. Never ever again",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center
31606,208,109,Italian,4,05/26/2019,"Service was better than usual especially for it being really busy.  Was charged $2 to substitute Alfredo sauce for marinara, I talked to a manager on the way out and he offered me a free desert to make up for it.  Food was good although portions seem smaller again.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center
31607,209,109,Italian,2,05/26/2019,"Usually love the olive garden. Actually want out of our way to eat here. The restaurant was very empty when we sat down but for some reason the hostess felt the need to put a family with a bunch of children right next to us, almost on top of us. We ordered drinks that didn't come for an extremely long time. Just the two of us dining yet the waitress only could ask one of us if we would like a refill. Never asking if we would like more salad or bread sticks. The worst service in any Olive garden. Go out of your way not to go here.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center

As soon as the waiter Kayla (brown roots, blonde hair and a leopard print mask) was made aware of the dissatisfaction the customer had with the salmon, she called them a liar and said there were no bones. Customer service was awful in that area and the tables were waiting too long without getting checked up on. The dining area was also cold, so the food became cold rather quickly. That and the breadsticks were stale, which was sad.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center

But worst of all, one family that had a table in the same section as ours thought it was cute that they let their little boy run around throughout the restaurant even on top of the cushioned benches. This went on for the entire time we were there and the father simply walked behind the boy smiling and watching to make sure he didn't hurt himself. I'm all for letting kids be kids and have some fun, but at what point do you start to teach them how to be respectful of others and behave in an open society?",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center

Olive Garden should be ashamed.  We ordered to-go and the quality was terrible. I really don’t this food would have been served for dine-in. VERY old breadsticks and salad.

I’ve never experienced customer service like this before. She was so genuine and professional that I couldn’t not write a review. The food and service there is always good but Maria takes it to another level. I will from now on go out of my way to ONLY go to the Paramus (Bergen Mall) location because of her.

The girl who took my name already had an attitude when she took my name. She said it’ll be about 20/30 minutes. So Because there were people waiting both Inside and outside, we decided to sit outside, actually right outside the front door on a bench to the right of the entrance doors. After almost 40 minutes, we had been sitting there and saw a worker come out every couple minutes and call names of people who had arrived after us. When I went inside and explained to the same girl I gave my name to that we had been waiting over 30 minutes. She said well we called your name at 9:18. I politely explained that we were sitting directly outside the front door literally the entire time, and the person seating people never came and called my name. She insisted that she did, like went back and forth with me a little bit still with the same attitude. But we never saw her, she actually never came outside and called for us and we were sitting right outside the front door!! The entire time!!  So after I explained that to her, the response I got was, oh well, now it’s gonna be another 15 minutes. Yet there was no one else waiting to be seated.. Terrible.

31644,246,109,Italian,1,05/26/2019,"The reason I’m writing that review is want to share my good & bad experience Last night!  Good: The waitress was served us extremely great, and the whole table having a wonderful time.  Bad: My party was arrived around 7:50pm, and the black lady with ＂afro hair style＂in front desk was take note with my name and she mentioned the waiting time was around 45-50 min! Since we really enjoyed to ate in there last time, we decided to wait. By that time, it is very crowded and I think it is normal. After waiting about 45 min, everyone went in expecting our group including the new group just sign in with 9 people (same as our party) Than I went up to the front and ask the ＂afro hair style＂lady, oh your name is not there and that why we let them in first. But 10 min ago, we checked with the same lady and she mentioned we are cleaning up the table for you now!  OMG, what is going wrong with her? She got a short term memory? Also she got a very bad attitude with me and maybe she doesn’t like Asian people. I had a feeling she knew that customer and letting them go first and which is very unfair for us to wait. By showing the other stuff my anger, their response was ＂I am not the one who take note with your name, I don’t know.

A little disappointing because that's not what's advertised online or tv.. Who wants to take cold food home ? Anyway I spoke with a really nice manager I believe her name was Monique .. I requested both orders were cooked and served hot and she honored it. That's what I call excellent customer service.. Def will keep coming back..why? The service && the food is okay,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center

But, the manager Ms. Allison listen to my concerns and she ensured I didn't leave feeling like I was not part of the Olive Garden Family.  I would take my chances and give Olive Garden another opportunity to get it right based on how Ms. Allison handled my dissatisfaction. Ms. Allison is a perfect example of how customers are to be treated.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center
31653,255,109,Italian,4,05/25/2021,They are good and fast. But they should double the bread bag for the hot bread gets moist from the heat causing the bag to get wet and burst open at the wrong end. Meaning all the breadsticks will fall to the floor.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center
31654,256,109,Italian,4,05/26/2019,"Olive Garden is pretty predictable. Food is pretty consistent, service decent, and overall, it is a comfortable place with good value for sure. As long as you don't compare this place to higher priced gourmet Italian restaurants, you will find the best things about this place are plenty of food options on the menu, reasonable prices, good-sized portions, consistent taste, and unlimited breadsticks and salad (or soup). For those reasons alone, you can count on a simple, budget-friendly meal here. The wine selection and prices are not bad either!    The only negative about this particular Olive Garden is the limited parking, but the adjacent mall parking lot is not a far walk. It is not the best food, but for the price, you get a lot of decent, processed food!",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center

31660,262,109,Italian,1,05/26/2019,"To start off we sign up for the waiting list online, and when we get to the restaurant we are told that they do not use the online waiting list. After a 50 Minute wait I walk up to the hostess and ask her how much longer for a table of 2 she tells me that my name is not on the list (Paper). I tell her that first they tell me they don't honor online and now that I was not on the list?! She tells me they do honor online and finds my name and sits me, in the middle of the restaurant without asking me for seating preference. After a 10 minute wait a gentleman walks up to us and says ""do you know what you are going to order"" no introduction, no welcoming attitude. I knew his name is Eric because I read his name tag. My wife asked him if we can sit in a booth, his response was I don't know and walked away. After another 3 minutes waiting he tells us we can move to a booth. At this point we are greeted by another server who introduced herself and made sure we felt welcomed her name is Elizabeth. We ordered an appetizer that tasted like if it was frozen and just reheated. The plate was hotter than the appetizer( as if it had been microwaved). The Entrees where bland and with no taste. My chicken was dry and felt like it had been reheated a couple of times before being served. We left the majority of the food and left the restaurant. The only reason for 1 star would be because of Liz's service and hospitality other than that they would not deserve even half of a star. This restaurant is very disorganized, the whole time we were at the restaurant, there was a table that was not cleaned.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center
31661,264,109,Italian,1,05/26/2019,I had to leave after waiting an hour and a half for my drinks and then being lied to about what drinks they were.

So far no big deal.. later on salads came and server forgot us when we asked for cheese. The flat breads we ordered was also forgotten but when it came the order was wrong. The server took it back and still waiting for it to come back. So to pass the time we decided to write good reviews while we wait.

We said ok. 1 hour into waiting my husband goes inside to ask and she goes ""oh yeah follow me"" we sit and waited 15 min for our server. This guy named erick comes to us and say ""are you ready to order?"" No introduction or anything. We requested to be move to a booth  and he said he was going to send somebody else to serve us. Another girl comes in 5 min later (she was very nice) and take our order. We get extremely salty breadsticks and unseasoned salad. Then we get our apetizer (bland and tasted frozen) afterwords food finally arrived (mind you... already 1 hour seated) and my husband's food was cold and bland and mine was horrible. At the end of the day we left more than half of the food and we paid with hard earned money.

Got our salad and the cheese grater broke. After 3 more cheese graters did the same i gave up on the cheese. Then when I used the pepper grinder black water squished out all over my food.. bar manager, Manny, was right next to me as I tossed the grinder into my salad and pushed it away . He did absolutely nothing but drink his drink and flirt with two women sitting next to me.  Thank goodness, Keesha, the barmaid saw my plight and immediately took control of the situation, apologizing and immediately getting me a new salad and cleaning up the mess. If it wasnt for her i would have walked out.  She is the only saving grace that place has.  Food was cold greasy.  Plates and silverware, when they finally came 10 minutes after my food, were dirty.

I thought he was just gonna take the hair from my plate and put the same plate on the table. No sorry, nothing! I still doubt it that it was a pubic hair. I told him I don't want that dish anymore. Then I ordered a cheesecake. It was totally different from the picture in the menu. I told him and he said he said something very low I didn't hear him then he just went away.

I ordered the three course deal for $12.95. The salad was ok, and I ordered the Parmesan-Potato Crusted Chicken. The entree was good and big. I'd say it's the biggest of the five entrees eligible for the deal when I compared it to what the other four at the table were having. May be the biggest meal but it's a tad bit on the greasier side. Service was great. The waitress Symone was courteous and prompt. She was even nice enough to replace my utensils for better washed ones. My only disappointment was the small size of the dessert, the dolcini. Then again, this was the same case that occurred with the dessert I got when I had a similar three course deal for $13 at another Italian restaurant.

She never came back, we asked one of the hostess and they said they were gonna look for her but obviously didnt, after a while we asked to speak to the manager, manager didn’t have answers either... after a while someone else, not our waitress or manager, came and gave us the receipts to sign, it turned out they charged the wrong thing on our cards and no one could come out and let us know... we will probably never go there again!",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center

To start things off, THIS PLACE WAS THE WORST OLIVE GARDEN I""VE BEEN TO EVER!~ My friend and I went in during dinner time and receptionist (I don't know why they need four of them at the front where obviously they are lacking waiters to help on tables) took us in at the back of the restaurant. We waited 30+ minutes and nobody showed up. I had to talk to busboy to bring waiter to our table. After 35 minutes of wait time, a waiter finally came and took our orders. Also, we ordered appetizer through the machine on the table as soon as we sat down, but since the waiter came late and food were sitting at the kitchen, the food were hard and cold. We still ate it because we were very hungry. Our dinner plates also came late to the point the other table, who came way later than us and order,  got their dinner plates first than us, which started to get me furious. I pointed to the waiter with an expression like "" Are you serious? where is our plates??"" After waiting about 40 minutes on our plates, the food finally came out but this is the moment where I was SERIOUSLY PISSED OFF. We ordered Seafood Alfredo and Tour of Italy. Tour of Italy was fine but Seafood Alfredo, they brought us Seafood Lasagna......... I told the waiter about this and the waiter obviously had no knowledge of the food... of which I told the waiter, this ain't Seafood Alfredo... the waiter disagreed and told us that THAT IS SEAFOOD ALFREDO... the pasta was obviously lasagna not linguine pasta. We continue to have argument on this situation and I had to call on manager. I explained the situation to the manager and she agreed that it wasn't Seafood Alfredo. Manager tried to help but by this time it was already 9PM and we had other plans to attend to so I requested that we leave without paying, which the manager allowed us to do so. I used to love Olive Garden but after this experience, I won't be going back again.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,1620 Bergen Town Center

38459,30,146,Italian,5,05/26/2022,"Food and service at this restaurant is always a pleasure.    I don't leave any reviews on any sites, but tonight I encountered  at Libretti's an issue of provoking racial profiling by a patron.  When a young lady walked in the door and stood by the bar. I thought she was Uber Eats or Doordash because she was just standing at the bar looking at everyone.  Well a few minutes later I was startled by the conversation I was overhearing about the young lady not being served because she was black. Well honey, she got my attention and all eyes were on her.  Being black, sitting with my black co-worker at the other end of the bar and knowing a lot of black delivery people are always in Libretti's picking up food. I couldn't believe the young lady was making any accusations about the girls behind the bar.  Well come to find out after the young lady left she was actually recording the whole provoking accusation.  Now listen, I don't tolerate any form of unfairness to anyone I don't care who you are and especially I wouldn't tolerate racism against someone black or of color. But right is right and wrong is wrong. And Queen Bre you were wrong tonight.    You stated in your arguments tonight that this was the second time you've been at Libretti's. So you should know to get the girls attention and place your order and then go sit down.  The dining room is in the back if you were looking to be waited on which you should know about.    You just don't sit and look at people then decide you are not being served because of your race and then start filming on your phone.  Because you didn't like the response from the girls behind the bar or the patrons responses sitting around the bar. Doesn't work like that hun.  If I'm at a restaurant not being waited on in 3-5 mins I will approach someone and ask a question, just so you know.  That's all you had to do.    Don't dis any place if you don't know the culture of the establishment.  Get an employee's attention and ask a question.    Sorry I had to write a book about the situation.",Libretti's Restaurant,554 Nassau St
38460,31,146,Italian,5,05/27/2019,"They took our reservation quickly. We were served promptly. Our orders were correct. The waiter was pleasant and didn't hover over us. Just the right amount email. We were a little cold, but they turned down the air conditioning at our request. The food ..... absolutely delicious!",Libretti's Restaurant,554 Nassau St
38461,32,146,Italian,5,05/26/2020,"As a VERY difficult customer to please , I scrutinize EVERYTHING , more than a normal human should ever be allowed to do. Nonetheless, after deciding where to celebrate my daughter's birthday (her choice from experience -15 or so years ago) I read several reviews choosing the negative ones which , to me, would be the most revealing. Acquiescing , to my daughter's request , along with my mother, the three of us made our way to Libretti's this past Saturday. As we entered , it wasn't clear if we were at the correct front door but we were directed to the rear area of the restaurant. After  We confirming our reservation , we were led to a cozy booth in a (thankfully) warm area and seated.. Long story short, there were plentiful choices and all seemed appetizing and and very descriptive. We ordered appetizers which we shared along with veal and seafood entrees. EVERYTHING was superb. You would be doing yourself a disservice if you miss the opportunity to dine here. My ONLY  complaint is that customers do not respect Libretti's enough to dress properly. Jeans, sneakers team tee-shirts ! Come on!  :(",Libretti's Restaurant,554 Nassau St
38462,33,146,Italian,1,05/26/2020,"This is my first time here and the service is absolutely horrible. If I could give no stars, I would! My sister decided to have her birthday dinner here and this has been the worst experience I've ever endured.  Not only did we wait for more than 30 minutes after ordering our food, but the shrimp was not fresh. If 3 people ordered different items that included shrimp and they were all wrong, that says a lot. We sent the dishes back and we are STILL waiting for food to come out; it has been 1 hour! Someone expressed that they are vegan and yet, their food was smothered in butter. The waiter came back to check on us after 25/30 minutes after we sent it back. If it weren't for my friend reaching out to ask him an question, he would not have stopped. We were told there is no manager on duty, and had to walk to the bar to speak with someone. Meanwhile,  tables near us have received their food and drinks and we're sitting here waiting.    Bottom line, this has been the worst experience at this restaurant and is completely unacceptable. I will not return!",Libretti's Restaurant,554 Nassau St

38466,37,146,Italian,1,05/26/2020,"I was invited to this restaurant for a Birthday Dinner Party. When I walked in at 7pm, the bartender on duty did not acknowledge me as she was having a personal conversation.  I asked about the reservation but no one could find us. The host did get that corrected and i was seated about 10 minutes later. Other tables that arrived after our party was served before us. Our food finally came out at 9:05. Myself and two other women (one of them pregnant ) ordered a shrimp dish but sent it back due to the shrimp having a sour smell. Our plates were removed at 9:11. Our entire dinner party finished there entire meal without so much as an offer of bread nor water  for the three of us with no food. The waiter did not even check on us once. By 10:05 the pregnant woman had to flag our waiter down just to be acknowledged/updated. The service was absolutely poor. And there didn’t even so much as apologize. After speaking with a manager and requesting the meal be compensated, unfortunately because the attitudes were so poor i didn’t trust the food(which came out at 10:11) so I sat for 3 hours. So ZERO stars for me.",Libretti's Restaurant,554 Nassau St

I have been coming here for years and never have I been treated any different because of my race, so let's not make this a race thing.   You're allegations are unfair, you were asked if you needed anything and you said no. I was watching and listening each time .. You made a seen for no reason.....",Libretti's Restaurant,554 Nassau St

38474,45,146,Italian,1,05/26/2020,"The only thing ""Italian"" about this restaurant is the name.  Very disappointing meal consisting of poorly prepared food.  Staff is friendly but sadly, this doesn't trickle down to the kitchen where the cook seems to have misplaced the olive oil & salt, as well as being unable to clean & cook shellfish properly.  My family & I used to come here & we returned with hopes of rekindling our love of this place.  Those ""hopes"" have been sadly dashed.",Libretti's Restaurant,554 Nassau St

If you do not normally find yourself in Orange, it's worth the trip, especially on a Friday or Saturday night when you can take in the amazing singer at Karaoke night after your meal.    I've never had a  disappointing meal here, big or small group.  I took a group of 16 people here for my fathers 70th birthday party... all very picky Italians, and not a single plate had any food left on it. That is saying a lot considering the huge portion size of the food, and the varried meals we all had.    Its my favorite place to takes friend who are out from the city for the night, or just a nice dinner for my boyfriend and myself.  I'm partial to the Twin Fusilli, but the seafood and steak had never let me down.  Prices are amazing... staff always friendly... atmosphere great!  LOVE.",Libretti's Restaurant,554 Nassau St

Listening and reviewing to people's comments about the food of the restaurant, we were in doubt whether to try or not, but what better to try and find out for yourself.  We ask for an order for pickup .  We are easy to impress and sincerely for the cost of the meals , we expected something better and not what we received. First the bread was not homemade, it was cheap bread,they not even put butter , the sauce was canned sauce (nothing wrong  with that), but the taste was weird , the order of hot antipasto was super small and did not bring much, in the order of chicken the rabiatta, the chicken was burned and smelled of burning. The penne order with sauce, it was tasteless, I had to add some seasonings and some parmesan cheese, for the children to eat.  very poorly made , no good !  We commonly buy in Bella Italia and we'll to continue getting food for thems, Librettis lacks much for the better !",Libretti's Restaurant,554 Nassau St

The shrimp was bland & it seems that the only thing they added was POUNDS of garlic. Instead of pasta I opted for a salad on the side. There was barely any salad & the tomatoes were not fresh. I didn't send it back because the kitchen closed at 10:30 & we got our food after that time. Plus, I didn't want anyone spitting in my food for returning it.

Food was excellent, some of the best Italian food I've ever had, including Gramma's!! We had calamari cooked perfectly Caeser salad with homemade dressing that truly tasted homemade and delicious.  My wife had eggplant rolatini with penne and vodka on the side. She said it was the best ever and although I've never been a fan of penne and vodka I took it to work the next day and even leftover and reheated I thought it was great. I have the ""venal Libretti"" which was veal wrapped in prosciutto, soppresatta and cheese (mozzarella I think) in a mushroom wine sauce over linguini. I could go on and on about how delicious it was and how fork tender the veal was, but I will sum it up in 1 word bestevermostdeliciousieverhad!!!Cudos to the chef! Service was excellant our waiter was a young guy who looked to be around 25 yrs old, I didn't expect him to be so engaging with us and so knowledgable about the menu considering he told us he ""was new there"" nonetheless he made our dining experience one of the best my wife and I have ever had ! He was so well versed and spoken he should run for Mayor there! All this food and fun for a spur of the moment Tuesday night dinner. 6 Stars all the way around!",Libretti's Restaurant,554 Nassau St

38489,60,146,Italian,3,05/26/2020,"Libretti’s is a long standing Italian restaurant in Orange. When you enter, there’s a nice size bar and lounge area with a corner dedicated to karaoke. In the back of the restaurant are three separate dining spaces. We had a reservation, which was necessary on a verybusy Friday evening.    Upon being seated, we were provided with bread, butter and water. After ordering our cocktails, it took at least fifteen minutes to receive them due to a busy bar. Regardless of the bar crowd, a 15 minute wait for drinks is excessive.    The menu has some interesting items that stray from just the typical Italian fare. I started with the chopped salad, which was a delicious mix of lettuce, onion, tomato, provolone, and sopressata in a light house vinaigrette. I then had the salmon Arturo for my main, which, unfortunately, was grossly over cooked to the point of being extremely dry.",Libretti's Restaurant,554 Nassau St

Upon us telling her we had religious dietary restrictions, she checked on all our meals to make sure we would be able to enjoy everything. She even directed us to things on the menu we could eat. She walked us through the menu with so much care. She check in with us and made sure we felt well taken care of. The food was so tasty! It was well flavoured and very filling!

I got my order 20 minutes after what was stated.  So i dont know if Olive Garden finagle the time it takes them to get the food ready Or what.    The service is great.    Got home and tried the shrimp scampi.  No asperagus but alot of asperagus stems.  Not as much food as if you would get in house. And it was too salty.  Ate the shrimp and broccoli (in place of tomatoes) and had to dump the rest.  Too salty.  I will tell you anout the salmon later.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,610 Sunrise Hwy

41691,11,161,Italian,3,05/05/2023,"Ordered two lunch portions of lasagna. It lacked seasoning. Half of the breadsticks were not buttered and salted so they were bland. The minestrone soup was good.

We had the lasagna fritters, the calamari, chicken alfredo, the Salmon and the tour of Italy, all amazing! Our server was Shaniqua who was very pleasant! Checked up on us regularly and got everything right. I also appreciated the fact that we were visited by three different managers during the time we were here, which is what made me really want to write the review. I work as a server/supervisor and appreciate that very much. Great experience, thank you!",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,610 Sunrise Hwy
41694,14,161,Italian,2,02/25/2023,"Service from my waitress was extremely subpar. She was not friendly, non accommodating and inattentive.

My experience here would've at least lived up to a mediocre standard had it not been for the poor service.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,610 Sunrise Hwy
41695,15,161,Italian,5,05/26/2021,"Well,  we were going to Olive Garden on Old Country Road in Long Island but traffic changed our plans.  We wind up going to Sunrise Olive Garden and all I can say is fantastic.  We ordered by phone and then we were approached my manager Tiffany. She showed how as a manager Tiffany assisted ifs on the menu that was good.  She was right the good was Fantastic. Instead of traveling from Coney Island to Old Country  Road this Olive Garden is worth traveling for.  A manager whom went above and beyond her duty to make sure my wife and I was and will be satisfied. Thank you Tiffany for all you do.  New customers to your restaurant.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,610 Sunrise Hwy
41696,16,161,Italian,1,05/26/2021,"We should've left the minute we were asked to wait outside, since the hostess was unavailable. We stood outside in the cold with 3 other parties, till invited in. Other employees were standing around with no customers in whole sections. Took forever to be waited on. Only 2 tables in site. Alec was our waiter, he was pleasant, and only positive of this location. We had salad and soup before drinks. Waited on cheese for a while for each course. Order was wrong, and bathroom was the vision of Covid. I understand new servers, but the bathroom had numerous employees in it. Not from NY, and our back home location put this location to shame! I don't know how Olive Garden would claim this location!",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,610 Sunrise Hwy
41697,17,161,Italian,3,03/27/2023,"Second time here. Love the lasagna. Mother loves the salmon. Service is off. Too long to come to table, brought wrong beer, asked for creamer, said had none. Never came back to table. Waited 7 minutes to get check. Bill was 58, paid with $100. Asked if we needed change. Both times, similar service. Can't be bothered.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,610 Sunrise Hwy
41698,18,161,Italian,3,03/27/2023,"Food was good. Waited over 20 mins to receive it and when we ordered, waiter didn’t  ask if we wanted the complementary soup or salad- had to get up and ask for it. While waiting for the food, my family and I finished the drinks and bread was not asked if we wanted more again, again had to go and ask. Not the best experience.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,610 Sunrise Hwy
41699,19,161,Italian,3,05/27/2019,We arrived during the lunch hour on a Saturday. Myself my mother and two of my children. There was a wait time of about 20-30 minutes.  This restaurant is very spacious and there were multiple tables sitting empty so we were surprised by the wait time. We did indeed wait for about 25 minutes.  The service was nice not great the food was not bad. However I did appreciate that the manager came to ask how things were. The one thing I hate at any restaurant and it happened at this service was that the main entree came minutes after we had just received our appetizers. It is so inconvenient and really disrupts the flow of the meal because the table gets overcrowded. Other than that Olive Garden is a nice place to go with a family to relax and spend time together.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,610 Sunrise Hwy
41700,20,161,Italian,1,02/25/2023,"The area surrounding the restaurant was full of litter. Looked filthy. On top of that, the walkway in was still dirty like they haven't swept or mopped.

Overall terrible experience",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,610 Sunrise Hwy

We waited over 30 min. call ahead ti avoidcthe wait or go onto the website and get in line there. They will give you a time to show up and everything. Parking is an issue because it is in the parking lot of a major mall and next door to a red lobster. We circled the parking lot for 20 min before finding a spot. Our friends waited over 30 min for a handicapped parking spot. This is definately an issue and we will not be going back to this location because of it.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,610 Sunrise Hwy

Asked for mushroom in my fettuccine Alfredo, they threw raw uncooked chopped mushroom in, no mixing, no sautee, just garnished my pasta with raw mushroom. Gross    Never gave me ANY BREADSTICKS, NOT ONE AT ALL.  I assumed it was protocollo when you order pasta dishes.  KEISHA was our waitress who didn't even refill my water once.  Its wild how if you're not an alcoholic drinking at 1pm people assume you're not a good tipping patron.

Was seated at 9:24pm.   We placed our orders at 9:30pm.   However, appetizers did not arrive until 10pm.   Our drinks did not arrive until 10:15.  Our main course meals did not arrive until 10:45.   After speaking with the general manager (Angela Zelaya) and she confirming a very bad service, she did nothing to accommodate us but offer us free dessert and credit us $12.79 for the appetizers.     This place,  is the worst.   Alec, our server, should have no business serving in this field due to his lack of experience and knowledge.

41718,38,161,Italian,1,05/26/2020,"This location always has an issue whether it is customer service or food quality. On my visit a few days ago however, it was the quality of the food which was a true disappointment. When my family and I went, my daughter ordered a kid’s meal with old grapes served to her that she couldn’t eat it. Afterwards, the most disgusting part was the breadsticks had MOLD on it. There was a huge blackish green mold growing on the bread already! Even though I brought it to the manager’s attention and she brought new bread and a discounted bill, it is still so unsettling to know how unsanitary their kitchen must be and how their food is being stored. This isn’t the first time that the quality of food or customer service has been a disappointment at this location.

There was a bit of the wait but after that we were seated I a quiet section - what we were looking for - and we placed our orders. Food and beverages arrived quickly and everything  was fresh and tasty. My only suggestion would be to add less ice in the limenade. It diluted it too much as most of the glass was filled with glass and drink poured over. Pina colada was mixed well.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,610 Sunrise Hwy

Shortly after I asked for a dessert and asked the waiter if we would have to wait so long for a piece of cheesecake and coffee he said right away and ended up bringing me my coffee 22 mins after the cheesecake.  Worst experience ever!!! I really tried to be patient and give the benefit of the doubt but this place is horrible. The other table was complaining that the waiter was giving them attitude.

I went in to the store 15 minutes after I was told it would be ready only to hear another 15 minutes which was actually more than 40. I don't blame the employees I blame this company and all the others, whose greed allows this to happen. I was sent an alert to check in but my food was no where near prepared. To find a spot to wait at this location was it's own obstacle and extremely dangerous. Then the food came out lukewarm and was only ok. I will never eat at any olive garden again and feel like I was stolen from then cheated. Over $100 to give  my son's mom what she wanted only to be completely disappointed, underwhelmed and dissatisfied.

41820,144,161,Italian,2,05/27/2019,"The Manager needs to be Fired!  It's a shame I had to open the front door for two old people while entering this Olive Garden its a shame that once inside at the front desk you feel no one is attending to you. The manager was on the phone near the bar with her Pink phone. The older gentlemen at the front counter tired giving the older people a table they did not like. As for me I was taken to the right side  and I noticed dirty tables with a few employees at the bar. My waitress was very nice and greeted me with lots of options. The manager I feel instead of sitting with her small staff at the bar needs to walk around and ask if we like the food. Please come and experience what I experience at this Olive Garden. The food was good and fully cooked, the food temp was good and the drinks were good. The only thing i like to hear "" Welcome to Olive Garden"". Make people feel good and keep the tables cleanier. Keep the tables clean....maybe a strong manager could do a better job... There  need to be some Spanish speaking people to serve the public I don't like when people smack their head to relieve an itch not cool.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,610 Sunrise Hwy

41823,147,161,Italian,3,05/26/2021,"The only reason I gave this Olive Garden 3 stars is because the waitress I had was so sweet and gave great service, and the food was decent. I wish I would of got her name, she had a Caribbean accent and served us at about 4:30 on 10/22, right of the entrance, by the bar was where I was seated. Besides that I would never go back to this Olive Garden. I didn't like the greeting when we first walked in and to top it off the staff and I believe a manager was arguing so loud it was very unprofessional. It lasted for a while, talk about a turn off!!",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,610 Sunrise Hwy
41824,148,161,Italian,3,05/26/2021,Since this is the only Olive Garden near the Nassau/Queens border it is pretty busy. The chicken scampi was bland.

I’m a huge Olive Garden fan and the food just wasn’t up to par. The chicken tasted old in the chicken parm. My dates lasagna didn’t even seem as a whole, it fell apart. More like the cheese was barely melted. The bread sticks was dry and hard. I’m honestly shocked of the experience.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,610 Sunrise Hwy

Orders came out wrong, they forgot to bring stuff out, and ran out of certain foods and drinks. Our waitress was frazzled but very nice and if she messed something up she quickly had it rectified. We normally have a decent time here whoch is why i am giving it a 4 instead of 3.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,610 Sunrise Hwy
41827,151,161,Italian,3,05/26/2020,"Waited an hour for a table on Saturday evening so be mindful of going at dinner time. The wait was due to the seating staff arguing over who should sit where. They sat smaller parties at tables that could have accommodated our party of 5 which led to us being skipped over two times. Too many chiefs and not enough Indians. This is not a 4 person job. But to their credit, they did eventually accommodate my party of 5. Otherwise, Olive Garden is always a safe bet for a decent meal. The waitress was excellent.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,610 Sunrise Hwy
41828,153,161,Italian,2,05/26/2022,"Best place to go if you want below average service.

41829,154,161,Italian,5,05/27/2019,The food was great. I mean unlimited salad. REALLY! And big enough to share with someone else. I hope they don't take that away any time soon. I had the build your own pasta for 11.99 and a lasagna desert (completely made out of chocolate) it was so delicious. I also had stuffed mushrooms with cheese. And I don't like mushrooms but they definitely made it taste good. Definitely coming back.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,610 Sunrise Hwy

41831,156,161,Italian,1,05/26/2021,The pasta is very unflavorful and the cheese they use is not very tasty either. The coffee is very sweet in my opinion. The salad had way too many banana peppers making the salad overly spicy. To give you a better idea there were at least 20 whole ones. I will never come back again.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,610 Sunrise Hwy

My order was delayed because it wasn't made to correctly and while waiting another customer took my order. Management offered me a gift card. I'm giving 4 stars because the staff and management were courteous and very apologetic for everything that happened. The gift card was offered without me having to complain.

I didn't feel rushed when giving him our order and before I even asked for the check he had it ready. Philip service besides the food deserve a 5 star rating.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,610 Sunrise Hwy
41838,163,161,Italian,3,05/26/2022,The food was ok. We've had better meals and service at that location in the past. The waitress forgot to bring the condiments after asking two times.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,610 Sunrise Hwy

41840,165,161,Italian,1,05/27/2018,Let me start off by saying we usually like eating at Olive Garden although this was the first time we visited this particular restaurant.  We arrived as a party of 4 and were told there would be a 5 to 10 minute wait.  We could see there were about 20 tables empty.  We were finally seated in about ten minutes at a small booth.  We asked if we could sit at the  table next to the booth which had more room.  We were again told we had to wait even thought there were still many tables empty.  We were finally seated and ordered out food and drinks. Our appetizer and salad came quickly but at the same time.  The salad had items we had asked to be left out and our drink order was wrong.  As we began to eat the app and salad our dinners came out.  We quickly ate our app and salad and started on our dinners.  The entire time we sat there we could see three waitresses in the corner texting on their phones and we could also see people waiting to be seated even thought there were at least 15 tables empty.  I can say the food was pretty good and our server was friendly but there rest of our experience was terrible. We will not return to this restaurant.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,610 Sunrise Hwy
41841,166,161,Italian,2,05/26/2020,"Service was extremely slow and it took close to an hour to get our food. A couple of times, the servers brought food to the wrong table.

41845,170,161,Italian,3,05/27/2017,"I had to ask our server for my drink about 3 or 4 times before he brought it out half way through my meal, while everyone else already had theirs. We had to ask for silverware and we had to wait a while to place our orders. Soup appetizers came out lukewarm. The place was not even full. At least he was polite and apologetic and the food was pretty good.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,610 Sunrise Hwy

The food is good but over your bill.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,610 Sunrise Hwy
41848,173,161,Italian,5,05/26/2021,"So I only really go to Olive Garden for the soup, salad, and breadsticks, and I don't really expect much else out of them. These three food items are usually good and satisfying, and the service is decent. My waiter, Patrick, last night delivered service that I could only call spectacular. It was only reminiscent of being in one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants in Las Vegas (not the food but his service). He was both tending bar and waiting tables and was the sweetest most charming man ever. I've rarely had an experience like this at all in my life, much less at a chain restaurant. Bless this man's heart for the warm experience he delivered last night in the midst of all the madness of covid and depression I've been wracked with over the last year.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,610 Sunrise Hwy
41849,174,161,Italian,1,05/27/2019,"I've been here a few time and service is getting worse and worse. Even on a quiet evening I've had to go find my server. Order was always wrong and had to be sent back, which I never do after being a server for 10 years. Servers or kitchen staff are not trained for allergys and I had food brought to the table with mushrooms (which I am highly allergic to) despite telling the server numerous times about my allergy. I kept trying to go back hoping it was just an off day. I used to love Olive garden but now I will never be back to this one. Hoping another one will be better.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,610 Sunrise Hwy
41850,175,161,Italian,4,05/27/2019,"I was pleasantly surprised with my last visit to Olive Garden. The food was definitely taken up a notch and service was great.

The lobster Mac was great as per my date and my soup, salad and bread sticks where perfect.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,610 Sunrise Hwy
41851,176,161,Italian,1,05/27/2019,"Food was good. Service started out good and got extremely bad. We had Neverending Pasta bowl, got our first order pretty quick, about 3/4 of the way finished we placed another order. We figured it would take a little while, it took over 20 minutes. By this time it was time to just pack up and go. The manager came over, showed her I had a coupon for a free birthday dessert, she told me to look at the menu to see what I wanted. She left. 10 minutes later the server came over and said ""did the manager take your dessert order?"" No. She turned around and left without taking my order. After another 15 minutes my wife got up and talked to another manager. He said ok and he disappears to the back. Another 10 minutes and my wife goes to another manager (the other one never came back out) and she finally comes over to take my dessert order and finally bring the check! Don't think I'll waste my time going there anymore. Oh and the first order they got wrong. I ordered spaghetti with sausage and of course they brought meatballs and it was the manager that took the order and brought the wrong order and looked at me like I didn't know what I was talking about.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,610 Sunrise Hwy

My intentions were to just walk tf out but I asked to speak to a manager. I dealt with Sherwin. Omg, he was empathetic and encouraged me to stay. He insisted on being my waiter for the night.

He was very rude and he didn’t have a paper and pen to take (write) our order and of course when the order came it was wrong and incomplete and when we asked for the missing things he had and actitud and keep saying I got you, I got you. This person didn’t know what is call customer service. We were 4 adults and 3 children. He even question why we want more salad if our food is about to come and the food came after 20 minutes.

The food taste very good however, It is painfully obvious that there have been some budget cuts apparent in things like the amount & the size of shrimp used in the dishes. The amount of sauce they put on the meal. (The white sauces in particular: alfredo, white wine garlic etc). I always order one of three meals there that I think are their best & have noticed that the pasta is getting drier & drier over time. Even after stirring it up from the bottom, I have had to ask for extra sauce each time. Even with the appetizer. Believe it or not, I'm not even an extra sauce loving kind of person.

41878,204,161,Italian,1,05/27/2016,Possibly the worst experience I've ever encountered. Waiter brought out my children's food before me and my wife even received bread sticks or salad. Finally after waiting at my table for 20 minutes with empty drinks wondering what's going on I got up and asked for a manager. When the manager came to the waiting area I told him the problem and he insisted that he would put our order through right away. When I said to him what's the issue with your staff he asked if I liked I can just leave. I have never seen such a poor managed establishment in my entire life. Being in the business I understand how things in a restaraunt get hectic and it's easy to lose track of things when busy. However on a Thursday night when the table wait time was 15 minutes and about 7 waiters on staff there is no excuse. I will never return to this location and I'm strongly considering never eating at the chain again. For a fairly new restaurant to the area I defiantly think change is in order before the staff drives the restaurant into the ground. Save your time and your money I got a better eating experience at McDonalds where my wife and I were forced to eat for the night.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,610 Sunrise Hwy

Order my drink and food at the same time and he brought me salad didn't offer cheese. Isn't that an Olive Garden ""thing"". Didn't check on me at all. Brought me my entree, still no drink. I asked him and he made it seem like it was my problem.  If you have a lot of time on your hands, like being ignored, and aren't that hungry for mediocre Italian food, then THIS IS A HIDDEN GEM!

By doing so  we were  forgotten by thy he waitress. After 15 mins no one came to our table, I had to go to front desk and ask what was going on. Salad came no breadstick which they are famous for. When we place our order for the stuffed shell which is new on menu they said we ran out. We orderd something else fries and chicken strips for my daughter which came with 5 fries and the waitress said will bring more fries which came another 15 mins after And this point i was furious and called the manager.

Even take-out is horrendous!!! DON""T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!    3/1/2020  So after the first horrible experience, I decided to give them another try at Sunrise Highway. My usual Olive Gardens is at Gateway Mall but I live closer to Sunrise Highway. So after ordering the ""create your own pasta"", it wasn't satisfying with taste, preparation or appearance . The manager Nicholas came and  redo it but it wasn't what we expected. We had another manager (short, pleasant African american lady with a bald haircut) who took it away and we ordered our regular Chicken and Shrimp Cabonara (cant go wrong with that). Our horrible experience was with our server Zena S. ,she started giving attitude the minute we poke to Nicholas about our food, which isn't her fault. Then she totally stopped serving us, Each time we needed something, we would need to call her or signal to her. She constantly walked passed us serving the next table. We asked for containers to-go, She just dropped them off and turned away,we waited 15 more minutes after that (after being in the (restaurant for over an hour because of the food) to see if she would bring a bag or our check. She DIDN'T. Our tablet had an error message on it, So we asked another server for help so we could pay.

They were pretty good.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,610 Sunrise Hwy
41895,221,161,Italian,5,05/26/2020,I was quite impressed when I went to this location.  Typically my experiences in Green Acres Shopping Mall has always been very poor but I have to say I was impressed with the food and most of the rapid service that evening and the menu. The only thing I have to complain is 1 HUGE thing there several available tables all over the restaurant and yet we still had to wait for 15 to 20 mins for any table. We eventually settled to dine by the bar area so we can get in and get out fast. Im still puzzled the lobby was filled with people in the restaurant and 80% of the place was absolutely EMPTY. My only advice get those people out of the lobby and get them seated fast... that tends to make people leave and go elsewhere when they see alot of people waiting ans waiting.  However I still recommend everyone to swing by and dine with this location.  Im hoping the next time we revisit the service is a little faster and we can actually eat at a table instead of the bar area.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,610 Sunrise Hwy

Lasagna roll ups weren't that great to me (my bf loved them tho) and the fried zucchini balls were delicious (bf didn't like these as much). Our entree made everything better though!!

Ok fine, then they take us to a table where only 4 can sit, there were 5 of us, 2 of which are 6ft tall. We ask for a bigger table. Waited 15 min like the people up front were all confused. We finally sit at a table only to have to wait for a waiter or waitress to come to us. Once he comes we give him the drink orders and forgo appetizers as it was getting late and the kids had school. It takes forever for the drinks to get there. About 20 minutes! Breadsticks came with no salad. Salad finally came to table with only half the drinks. I mean no complex drinks were ordered. A glass of wine, a coke, a smoothie and virgin pina coladas. Took long for dinner to come also. We needed ketchup for French fries which did not come,  we had to ask again. No time in between were we asked if we needed anything, if we were ok. If it was not for the young girls birthday I really would have left. We made the most of it for her day.

41921,248,161,Italian,1,05/27/2019,As I am currently sitting at this establishment I can't help but to think that this type of experience is exactly why I stopped going out to eat altogether.    15 minutes passed for us to be seated without anyone else waiting.  Then we weren't actually seated until my wife went to the manager that was trying to figure out a 7 dollar transaction and had something to say.  Then we finally get seated only to see the couple that came in 10 minutes after us get seated AND SERVED immediately.    Meanwhile we sit and wait for another 10 minutes for our waiter to come out and basically tell us that everyone is trying to go home so that's why we waited so long.    Then the salad comes and its enough for one person.  When asked why we had gotten so little the waiter who is ready to go home decides to share that his manager is complaining about waste and spending and the cooks are complaining of waste.  Not my problem but whatever.    Wouldn't have been so bad had we not witnessed other tables getting served with salads filled to the brim.    Breadsticks were lukewarm with hardened bottoms...I sent the rest back and this is normally my favorite part.    The manager has not one time come over to make sure things were ok...its honestly not even a surprise.  This is the 2nd time we were treated like this visiting this location.    Never again.  The only...I mean ONLY reason I stayed is because my wife (who is pregnant) was hungry.    Never again.  Green Acres OG has got to do better.    If you wanna go home at 9...get a job that lets you off at 9.  If you close at 10...treat everyone that comes through until 9:59 with the best service you're capable of.

It was late and we were not too hungry so after eating our salad and having to return the appetizer because it was uncooked, I asked the waitress, Amanda, for to-go boxes.  We got the boxes but mine was not closing properly.  I asked her for a new box and when she came, she took a dirty fork from my friend's plate to use to scrape out the food.  I took the box from her and told her she could not do that.  She started to ask me if I was OK and nothing was wrong with what she was doing and that is something she does all the time.  I was so furious, I just paid and left.  I could not even finish my drink.  She did not realize how unsanitary that was.  Secondly, she doesn't know who she is serving and the trouble she can get her restaurant into.  It makes me question the things that really happens around the back. I hope someone from the main office see these negative reviews and do something.  Quite frankly, they didn't deserve my one star - from raw appetizer to unsanitary service.

As our friend suggested, we shared almost everything bc the portions are huge. We had lasagna, chicken linguini, calamari, garlic spagetti (only vegan main dish I guess) and went on with cheesecake and chocolate cake (no flour and served with fresh cream ), and the coffee was also great.

50973,55,209,Italian,1,05/26/2022,"My family has dined at The Rustica several times in the past with no issues with the service or food. My wife, daughter and I had a Valentine's date night. We were seated outside which wouldn't have been an issue if more outdoor heaters/heat lamps were used. The waiter was not attentive to our table. Course meals 1 and 2 were brought to our table at the same time, making Course 2 meal cold by the time it was eaten. Course 3 main entree was received cold. Asked waiter for water a couple times before it was provided. For dessert had requested for coffee which never was received. My daughter was seated in an aisle where there was much walking traffic and was bumped several times either by guests or servers during our dinner. Ambience was good with having live musicians performing. We didn't finish our meals and left earlier than anticipated not only due to cold temperature but also service. What would have made our experience better during our visit:  seated inside (which there were empty tables) or more heaters available, attentive waiter/server, better seating location not in an area where much walking traffic, quality of food was good but received cold. From this experience I would most likely not recommend to family/friends.",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd

I give that to the waiter immediately ( hoping that he brought me back a new set). My friend also had hair on her napkin. The food was merely edible. Maybe Olive Garden lowered their standards since I last came here a year ago. The waiter was maybe overworked or the only one on staff because he was too busy to take a complete order. I canceled part of it. My takeout order was incorrect but at that point I just wanted to get out of there so I took it as is. Olive Garden is a beautiful restaurant as far as chains go.

Per usual my pictures are after I've already started eating. I really liked the Oxtail Ragu and the braised short ribs with gnocchi. They could use just a touch more seasoning and spice even after adding a ton of red pepper flakes. The glazed stuffed pork chop was entirely too sweet. There was nothing to balance the sweet flavor at all. The bread wasn't worth the calories. I love sourdough but this one the crust tasted burnt and the chewy inside had no flavor. It couldn't be redeemed with butter or olive oil. If you go, try the Oxtail Ragu over the gnocchi and I think you'll have a hit.",Paisano's,132 Park Ave

45189,3,180,Italian,3,04/26/2023,"Nice atmosphere and great service. I have some mixed feelings about the food. The pistachio cheese cake was excellent, however the short ribs with gnocchi was not that good. The ribs where burnt on the outside and the sauce tasted like a tomato sauce added after, not a sauce made from the braising liquid. Also the bread that they charge for seemed over baked with a very thick hard crust that tasted slightly burnt. This is coming from someone who loves a good crusty bread and would be happy to pay for a good one.",Paisano's,132 Park Ave

45191,5,180,Italian,5,12/27/2022,Food quality was great but was a bit pricey for our group of 6. Portions were filling and they are able to accommodate gluten free substitutions.    Service was outstanding.    The restaurant itself can feel a bit cramped when dining indoors. I believe they have outdoor seating as well.,Paisano's,132 Park Ave
45192,6,180,Italian,5,02/25/2023,"Always a great meal here. Have been coming here for years and years and years. We had a great dinner here on a busy Saturday night. Marc was our server and he was fantastic! So friendly, very attentive and had us laughing all through the meal. Highly recommend Paisano’s for any special occasion or just a really good night out! Food is delicious!!!",Paisano's,132 Park Ave
45193,7,180,Italian,1,11/27/2022,The food here used to be amazing. We have been going for over 6 years now for special occasions. The last 2 times it was not up to their old standards-- even the short ribs aren't like they used to be (new chef?).    We sent back over cooked cardboard calamari.   My father-in-law was very disappointed with his food and he used to love this place.    Also for the love of god PLEASE change the terrible music. It's like being in an elevator-- torturous. I wouldn't go back based on that. It's not versatile (I am not saying to play Italian music-- just play something that isn't a repetitive beat). Decor is also strange.    And the bathroom was disgusting... like no one cleaned it in weeks.    I don't leave many bad reviews--this comes after years of liking a place and it going down hill. I get food prices are expensive but don't cheat me on quality. I would rather pay more if I plan on having a nice meal and leave happy.    Sorry Paisano's -- time to get it together again with a refresh.,Paisano's,132 Park Ave
45194,8,180,Italian,5,05/26/2022,"This place is perfect for a date night. Classy, romantic, and amazing food. The portions are big and flavors perfect. I can't wait to come back here again.

45195,9,180,Italian,3,02/25/2023,"It was my first time there. Service was good and staff was friendly.  Food was good as well.  They only thing that Floored me was that while waiting for our food, I said to another at my table, why didn't we get bread?  And I was told we had to order a sourdough bread basket from the appetizer section of the menu! WHAT!!!  I know times are hard, but not even to put bread on the table to me is a disgrace.  I think they can put bread on the table given their prices on the menu are not exactly cheap.",Paisano's,132 Park Ave
45196,10,180,Italian,4,01/26/2023,"So the trick to enjoying Paisano's in winter is to go at a very early time for late lunch or early dinner, to avoid the noise level when it's full. On the other hand, when our table of 5 is the only one in a room, the absence of atmosphere in any of the newer rooms is glaring. I chose a pear and feta ravioli which was lighter than most dishes ordered, with a complex sauce just this side of too sweet. Only one type of gluten-free pasta was available, disappointing. If Paisano's once had charm, it traded it for larger capacity and noise at a level that prevents conversation. Think I'll return only to have lunch on the patio in summer.",Paisano's,132 Park Ave
45197,11,180,Italian,5,02/25/2023,"The calamari was tasty, crispy and not greasy.  The bread  was delicious and the sauce it comes with was also delicious.  It was my first time having an olive base tomato type of sauce to go with the bread, in the form they serve it. And the chicken francaice was tender, juicy,  the right balance between the lemon and butter.  Needless to say I had a phenomenal meal.",Paisano's,132 Park Ave

She said I have to pay for bread which I never heard of that in Italian restaurants.,Paisano's,132 Park Ave
45203,18,180,Italian,3,04/26/2023,"We used to love this place.. used to. Went with a large group (13) for my Mom’s birthday. From the start things were not handled well. I asked the waitress ahead of time if she would split the bill between two groups to make paying the end easier for everyone and she said she could not. I’ve been to enough places to know this is possible but I said fine we will pay as a group. We got charged for bread?!?….. lol. I’m Italian. When I go to an Italian restaurant I expect bread! And for free no less. So weird and off-putting. Then we were told they don’t have a menu for kids so we can order them a bowl of pasta with butter and a chicken cutlet. $27 later for a 3 year old’s dinner!!!!! Wth? The bill was astronomical and the gratuity was not added in for us. Again, 13 ppl for $700..the gratuity should be added into bill. I think we are done with this place. ",Paisano's,132 Park Ave

We were seated in a dark cubby in desperate need of paint,  but at least it was quieter than the main room so my guest could hear. Staff -Very amiable. Food, very nice; we had fish. But all of that was for naught as I had to endure looking at wall in need of painting and to my right, a COCKROACH   traversing the wall. Couldn't leave with a 91 year old expecting dinner, and had to eat so as not to create a scene.  Thank goodness she did not see the bug. Hopefully they will address the problem.

45207,22,180,Italian,1,02/25/2023,"We were going there for many years, always was a great place. Last night dinner was a nightmare. Front desk girls were terrible, food is not as it was before. I wouldn’t go there again , so sad:(",Paisano's,132 Park Ave
45208,23,180,Italian,4,02/25/2023,"The food was really good, the atmosphere  was too down in all sense, the food took too long (and the restaurant was empty) the waiter was a little bit arrogant and there was nobody in the front desk to attend, so we were waiting there for roughly 5 mins until we went inside by ourselves.    Bottom line ""food was good""",Paisano's,132 Park Ave
45209,24,180,Italian,5,05/26/2020,"Delicious restaurant right in the heart of Rutherford! The inside of Paisanos has cute decor friendly staff and a calming atmosphere. We had 7 people to sit down and it went off without a hitch. Warm delicious bread was served with a red pepper olive oil dip. We had ordered a few appetizers. Calamari, salads, fried mozzarella, eggplant and more. I ordered the pasta carbonara, Salmon, grouper, braised beef raviolis, Bolognese sauce, spicy pasta and more. The desserts were delicious. Apple crumb bake & lava cake. Great place for a nice night out !! Thank you ",Paisano's,132 Park Ave
45210,25,180,Italian,4,05/26/2020,"Paisano's makes the best cream sauces!  If it's your first time dining here try something with their vodka sauce or sambuco cream sauce.  They start you with delicious fresh bread and a sun dried tomato oil to dip it in. For appetizer I had the eggplant rollatini which was good!  For dinner I had the lobster ravioli in delicious sambuco cream sauce!  The sauce was so good that after I finished my raviolis I scooped whatever was left of the sauce with my spoon!  For dessert I had the peanut butter Tiramisu, and if you love peanut butter like I do definitely order it!  It was so good!  The only thing I was disappointed in is I wasn't aware there was any specials that day as I was never told of any.  After I already placed my order I heard my waiter recite a list of specials to another table.  Prices are reasonable here, and the food is good!  I recommend dining At Paisano's in Rutherford!",Paisano's,132 Park Ave
45211,26,180,Italian,2,05/26/2021,"Our dining experience was very disappointing.  We made reservations at 8:15, but weren't seated until 8:40.  We ordered apps and entres pretty soon after we sat down.    Our apps came out quickly and were Delicious - the barrata and stuffed eggplant.  Our entres didn't come out until 9:45... at which time, the lights were turned on in the dining room because the restaurant has to close at 10pm.  Tables around us that were seated after we were, had received their entres and were finished eating before ours came out.  The waiter said he'd see if we could stay a few minutes after 10, since we just got our food, but they weren't allowed to.    No one came to check on us, ask how our food was, appologize for it coming so late.  We had to rush through our food, no time for dessert or coffee and then were given boxes.    The dry rub ribeye I ordered medium rare, came out close to well done and rather than an herb butter sauce, had a thick, dark sauce.  My boyfriend really enjoyed his pappardelle rustica though.  The waiter asked if we wanted bread, we said no, he brought it anyways and also charged us.    The restaurant itself had a very nice atmosphere, which is why we were excited to try this place, but very disappointed at the service and our experience.  1:45 should have been plenty of time for a nice, relaxing dinner.",Paisano's,132 Park Ave

They also don't tell you the prices of any specials until you get it on the receipt. That is a bit bothersome to me. I'm not a stickler with cash but for $34, I would expect more than potatoes and fish on top. You also have to PAY FOR YOUR BREAD, which to me is just ludicrous. The atmosphere is lovely and the service was nice but they way overcharge their dishes for a quality that is just not quite there...and I don't think I'll be back.",Paisano's,132 Park Ave

The apps are good if you like seafood, which is the running theme hear. I am not a fan, but for the main dishes they did have a choice of steak, pork chop and veal. They also had homemade pasta dishes and the desserts were delicious. I gave 4 stars only because I didn't enjoy the apps. but all the other dishes were great.  Even the coffee to end the evening was tasty.  If you have money to spend on a more upscale dining experience then this is a good choice.

45248,63,180,Italian,1,07/30/2022,"I give Paisano's one star not because of the food, but because of the terrible service we received from one of their servers they have working there. My friend from the jersey shore and her daughter with special needs came for a visit. My daughter and I took them to Paisano's bc it's our go-to place for special occasions. I’ve been going to Paisano’s for 20 years and have always enjoyed the food and experience while I was there. We left our husbands at home, but we were planning on bringing them home dinner from there as well bc we wanted a girls night.    When we got there at 6 pm, the server wasn’t friendly from the beginning.  He never told us the specials, so we ordered off the menu. There was only one other table there, who happened to be sitting next to us, when we then overheard him minutes later going to the table next to us, much more chipper, and gave them the specials. When he was finished with that table, we asked to hear the specials since he never told us. He first said that he just found out about the specials and then told us what they were. We declined anything from the specials, he snarkily replied that it was too late anyway because our order was in and sauntered away.    Throughout the evening, he never checked on us, never gave us any feelings of being welcomed. He unfriendly that we wanted to leave bc we felt uncomfortable. We ended up staying but decided to pick up our husband’s meals at a restaurant a few doors down instead.    I called the restaurant a day or two later and relayed our experience to their manager. He told me that this server was one of their longest, best servers. I stated behavior towards us put a damper on the experience of eating there and after that, I will go to the many other Italian restaurants on Park that would be happy to have our business. The manager said he would give us free coffee the next time we came. I repeated that I wasn’t going back bc of his behavior/ our experience s he suggested speaking with the owner.

When asked to have some grated cheese....they come over and grate it over your dish...asked if he could leave some...said NO...they can't leave the block of cheese.

45254,69,180,Italian,3,10/28/2022,Appetizers- Calimari was undercooked  They do no provide a salad or bread  Main course was hit or miss.  Regardless of how busy you are you Need to have more consistency if they want to stay in the game.,Paisano's,132 Park Ave
45255,70,180,Italian,2,12/27/2022,Waiter not friendly food ok but highly overpriced w no pretty atmosphere..charge for bread that was not fresh..hard not edible..parking horrific..,Paisano's,132 Park Ave
45256,71,180,Italian,5,12/27/2022,Amazing restaurant. High upscale place. Loved the copper ceiling,Paisano's,132 Park Ave
45257,72,180,Italian,2,05/26/2022,We had high hopes due to the high reviews but I was sadly disappointed. Starting with the fried Calamari it was rubbery and had little flavor. The chicken parm was passable but the sauce was rather watery.  I know it was warm for December but it was extremely  hot in the dinning room. I wanted it to be so much better.  Also charging $2.50 for bread come on. Will not be coming back unfortunately.,Paisano's,132 Park Ave
45258,73,180,Italian,2,05/26/2022,"Extremely disappointing. Over rated, over priced and very underwhelming. For the amount of money and hype this restaurant generates, other then the fact the pasta is home made, everything else is subpar. The service is a complete disappointment. The waitress who waited on us seemed inconvenienced. We asked her to bring the prosciutto on the side, instead on the bruschetta (we had someone who doesn’t eat pork), she absolutely refused and still served it on. Our friend could not enjoy it, even though he didn’t miss much. The sourdough bread basket (which we had to order and not complimentary), was huge hunks of burnt bread. I had to ask for olive oil with the bread. What Italian restaurant serves bread with butter and not EVO? My friends ordered the chicken and stuffed sole. Felt like something I could eat at Olive Garden for half the price. The only dish worth remembering was the linguini with white clam sauce. That was delicious. Hence the 2 star, or else I would have given them a 1. All in all, a complete disappointment. And waste of money.",Paisano's,132 Park Ave
45259,74,180,Italian,5,08/29/2022,The food was absolutely delicious. My wife and I ordered 4 dinners and tried them all we couldn't say anything bad about any of them,Paisano's,132 Park Ave

45264,79,180,Italian,1,05/26/2022,I normally never give a bad review however we threw out our dinner. We ordered Chicken Penne Vodka and  Spaghetti Carbonara. The Carbonara tasted like old grease frying oil. Then once we tasted the chicken it was the same flavor. I'm not sure if the grill had not been cleaned but both meals were terrible.,Paisano's,132 Park Ave
45265,80,180,Italian,5,06/30/2022,Sat in the beautiful patio area. My wife and I enjoyed beautiful meal of stuffed veal and a fish entree as well as stuffed mushrooms. Waiter was top notch food was perfect.    .,Paisano's,132 Park Ave

45267,82,180,Italian,4,05/26/2022,Food and service are excellent. The back patio is beautiful. Prices are noticeably higher than pre-pandemic. My only regret is that we didn't ask to be moved to another table because we were seated right by the speaker and it was hard to have a conversation without straining to hear. Otherwise a great experience and look forward to going back.,Paisano's,132 Park Ave
45268,83,180,Italian,5,05/26/2021,My husband took me here for Valentine’s Day. I was pretty impressed. Very nice intimate ambiance. BYOB can’t get better than that. The food was amazing. Took advantage of the 3course meal ordered the mussels and chicken parm which might have to be the best I’ve had in a long time. Don’t get me started on the chocolate molten cake! Highly recommend and will be returning.,Paisano's,132 Park Ave
45269,85,180,Italian,3,05/26/2022,"The place is very nice asthetically,  staff was very attentive and personable and overall was clean and quaint. The food however was ok, not worth the price they ask for.  The portions are fair sized. The tap water tastes terrible. We didn't realize it's BYOB and the drinks have all the waters after taste because of the ice. Bring your own drinks it throws off the taste.",Paisano's,132 Park Ave

45276,92,180,Italian,5,05/26/2020,Went here for lunch today and was served by a very sweet waiter named Edgar. The service was exceptional as well as the food. The olive oil was amazing and infused with such flavorful rosemary. The sourdough bread and pasta was made in house and it was incredible! Edgar made sure everything was just the way we wanted and was very patient and accommodating with any modifications. We will definitely be back!,Paisano's,132 Park Ave

45278,95,180,Italian,2,05/26/2021,"First impressions, the restaurant looked amazing from the outside. Then everything kind of trembles after that.  They forgot to clean under the table, there were few calamari there. The food was very disappointing . We ordered grilled octopus, which was chewy and a bit old. we asked to change it they just grilled another piece from the same batch a little longer which was also chewy, but warmer.  I ordered an oxtail ragu and honestly the tomato sauce was tasteless and the meat also was chewy and some pieces are hard to even chew.  We expected a lot more than what we got, looking on how nice the service and the server were.  But unfortunately good service and good lighting don’t make the food taste better.",Paisano's,132 Park Ave
45279,96,180,Italian,5,05/27/2018,"Service and food are incredible.  The menu sometimes makes you wonder if it's any good but it doesn't matter what you pick,  it 's all so great. I go there mostly for the fish platters but the stuffed pork chop was out of this world.  The waiters/waitresses speak so delicately when announcing the specials that it even causes your mouth to water.  Great place! A bit noisy at times but you have to go to understand why the noise and  you will understand it.",Paisano's,132 Park Ave
45280,97,180,Italian,5,05/26/2022,Paisano's is a great Italian restaurant.  Its ambient n decor is perfect for date night n friends/family night. It's BYOB.  The food is delicious and so are the desserts.  I highly recommend this place.,Paisano's,132 Park Ave
45281,98,180,Italian,5,05/26/2021,Classy/ fancy restaurant. All of our appetizers and dinners were expertly prepared. Our waiter Steve was attentive and when he spoke to us he spoke loudly and clearly. And this was on Mother's day with a crowd. Great job!,Paisano's,132 Park Ave
45282,99,180,Italian,5,05/26/2022,"I love this place. It happened to be a bit on the humid side in the outdoor patio that night. However, the food more than made up for it. Deep fried burrata you evil geniuses! I had the Ribeye special cooked a perfect medium rare very tasty but when I tried the bronzino my wife ordered that was hickory smoked and pan seared served with pesto mashed potato, I was jealous.",Paisano's,132 Park Ave
45283,100,180,Italian,3,05/27/2018,"When I started coming to this place over a year ago I thought that the service was one of the best at NJ restaurants. Since then my opinion has decreased slightly. The food has been great I'd say 8 out of the 10 times I've visited. Last two times the appetizers were cold and the pasta didn't taste as great. Overall, I'd say it is still worth a visit. The restaurant is BYOB but they make up for it with the higher prices charged. Typical bill for a group of 4 would be $120-$150 without tip.  I was also here for Mother's Day this year. I did not appreciate the fact that they added a surcharge of $10 to all of the meals. $30 for a plate of pasta in suburban NJ is not in touch with reality. I could go to a Michelin starred restaurant for the same price.",Paisano's,132 Park Ave
45284,101,180,Italian,5,05/27/2019,"The. Best. Steak. I've. Ever. Eaten. No joke. I've had many steaks in my day but this was hands down the best by a large margin. They marinate it overnight in a sweet and spicy sauce and it was cooked to perfection. I like mine medium and it was juicy pink in the center and charred to perfection on the outside. I think I had an out of body experience. I had to ask for more bread to make sure I didn't waste any of the sauce on the plate. Everything was great, but that steak was to die for.",Paisano's,132 Park Ave
45285,102,180,Italian,3,05/26/2021,"Food was decent, apps were decent also,dessert was decent, service was excellent.  3 stars due to the restaurant charging you for bread i though that was low. Also lots of tables were empty at 8pm  but they let everyone wait outside even though tables were empty since we were there.",Paisano's,132 Park Ave
45286,103,180,Italian,4,07/30/2022,"The Italian food was very good, service was excellent, 4 stars because of the 3% service charge if using credit card, Covid excuse.",Paisano's,132 Park Ave
45287,104,180,Italian,5,05/27/2018,"The food was delicious and prepared perfect. The waitress was excellent and she knew the menu very well. We had some calamari a couple of different ways (on the menu). For dinner 2 Veal dishes off the menu, the Veal was cooked perfect and tender. We also had two orders of the short ribs over gnocchi. They were great. 7:00 resavaction sat down at 7:00pm. Tough place to park.",Paisano's,132 Park Ave

45292,109,180,Italian,2,05/26/2021,"Food's good, but the experience has been less than great when I go. I had made a reservation for myself and all my coworkers for lunch there - specifically in the patio area. Before hanging up, the man said, ""Ok see you this afternoon, bye"". We get to the restaurant on time for our reservation only to be told we didn't make one. And then a group of 9 came in, also had reserved the patio area. Once I pressed the host showing the call I had made that morning, they said they didn't hear me correctly or I mis-spoke, but the man who picked up definitely did based on how he ended the call. My guess is they overbooked and didn't want to admit, but I would've appreciated an apology. Other than this instance, the wait to get in is generally long and you usually have to get your server's attention.",Paisano's,132 Park Ave
45293,110,180,Italian,5,05/26/2020,Enjoyed my dining experience! Lasagna was delicious and perfect portions. Great selection of wines to choose from. The service is prompt and friendly. Prices are moderate. Decent place to have Italian food.,Paisano's,132 Park Ave
45294,111,180,Italian,2,05/26/2021,The food is good but the service was awful. The server continued to refill my three young kids drinks only to find out they charged us for each one. In addition they charged $2.50 for bread and the waiter did not mention it. Poor attitude and was just trying to inflate the check,Paisano's,132 Park Ave
45295,112,180,Italian,5,05/26/2021,an excellent experience and outside dining the reservation was just about on time we were told from the beginning it may take a little longer to be served because of the long run and the fact all the tables are in the street.  you're able to view the menu after scanning a card with your phone  the server was very attentive they're not allowed to pull your wine cuz of all the rules  If you're looking for some good outside dining definitely give them a try,Paisano's,132 Park Ave

45297,115,180,Italian,3,05/26/2020,"The service was better than the food. To be fair, we may have ordered wrong. But, everything on on a 4 or 5  restaurant menu should be excellent. One of the items was fish of the day and it was just too busy. The other was also a seafood dish and it was overcooked and was swimming in something too much like a soup rather than a sauce. I'd try again but stick to pasta and meat.",Paisano's,132 Park Ave
45298,116,180,Italian,5,05/27/2018,"My favorite Italian restaurant!! Always great service and never disappointed with a meal. My all time favorite is the spinach chicken ravioli.

My friend's steak....don't try...  Service was great, but we came here to eat, and even the best service can't replace the food which was terrible. I'm really disappointed.

45306,124,180,Italian,3,05/26/2020,"My wife and I first visited this restaurant exactly one year ago on her birthday. She order a pasta dish ""mountain and sea"" and I ordered the ribeye.we enjoyed it alot. The only reason why we haven't gone in a year is because it is so expensive. Then we went back today(her birthday) and ordered the same thing. She had not eaten all day in anticipation. She was very disappointed saying the pasta tasted funny then said it had no flavor. And that is with a huge load of fresh parmesan cheese shredded on top. I tasted it and (although she has much more discerning taste buds than myself) I thought that the pasta almost like it had been soaking in the water way too long. This was at 5pm(ish) so I don't see how this happened. My ribeye steak was supposed to be medium rare but was much closer to medium. The sauce was supposedly""spicy hot"" but it was not spicy at all. But it tasted ok I guess. My biggest disappointment was the ""ribeye"" steak tasted like cheap Chuck steak from ShopRite. Between the cheap tasting steak, the non spicy sauce, the watery tasting pasta..it was not worth the 100$ (with tip) that we paid. The service was very very good. Almost a bit too good. (A bit over solicitous in my humble opinion) I do not penalize the wait staff. We won't be going back. Texas Roadhouse is a much better value proposition.",Paisano's,132 Park Ave
45307,125,180,Italian,1,05/27/2018,"We went to Paisano's last night. We had a 6:30 reservation for four. We arrived at 6:20, so we expected to wait 10 minutes to be seated. That wasn't what happened.  I  would like the owner to know that your hostess staff (especially the young one with lighter hair) they are rude and incompetent. After waiting 40 minutes past our reservation as well as watching countless people without reservations get seated, we asked why we weren't being seated. They kept saying, ""We're working on it.""  Parties of 4 were going in without a reservation,  so that was untrue.  Finally, we were seated to a wobbly table in the back while passing empty tables that remained empty all night.  Two of us were celebrating birthdays, so we certainly picked the wrong place. The only positive thing the entire night was our waiter Carlos who was great and apologized for the horrible hostess.  With all of the great restaurants in North Jersey and nearby Manhattan, skip Paisanos...........its not worth the aggravation!!!",Paisano's,132 Park Ave

I have to say this place has a nice decor excellent service . I do recommend to make reservations- the place can get packed at times.  One of the Best part - BYOB !    The food here is excellent with the right amount to leave you full - not family style  but just the right amount on you plate    The bread comes out with a red dipping sauce ( very good ) - you can ask for butter if u like but you wouldn't need to    The octopus salad is very good , only complain, it's very small not enough to share.   the tomato slice is larger than the actual octopus.  Yet  perfectly grilled.",Paisano's,132 Park Ave

I ordered a rosemary chicken sandwich and was blown away. Something that sounds so simple was full with flavor and richness.    As it was for lunch i held back on ordering a pasta as it would be heavy fair for midday but they advertise that it is made fresh daily.    I would not only recommend this restaurant to others ... i would take my super picky girlfriend for a nice dinner....    A+ all around....,Paisano's,132 Park Ave

The menu was limited, which we understand, but my husband's Mozzarella Carrozza was still frozen and my Calamari was burnt. The entrees were good, the Branzino and Fettuccine Mountain and Sea. We were in the ""loud"" room, which is what I call it, so we could hardly hear each other or Jemil our waiter. After dessert and coffee we asked for the check. After waiting 15 minutes to get the check, I had to ask again. My husband couldn't wait so he went to get the car. I had $100 Gift Card to use. At this point I just wanted out of the restaurant so I gave Jemil the GC and my Amex to cover the rest. I didn't even look at the check since I knew it was a fixed price. I couldn't hear him correctly when he brought the check back. I thought he said that I had to leave 18% tip minimum so I wound up double tipping him! He got a $50 tip! So all in all we're not happy with our experience last night and not sure if we will be coming back to Paisanos any time soon. It a shame since this was my favorite restaurant :(",Paisano's,132 Park Ave

45324,142,180,Italian,1,05/26/2021,I was looking forward to taste the food here. The restaurant was almost empty.  I sow through the window. As soon as I walk in the hostess say waiting time is 25 minutes.   I think they just didn’t want any more customers because they close in one hour.   I hope the owner see this. Because I think it’s not right,Paisano's,132 Park Ave
45325,143,180,Italian,5,05/26/2021,As usual Paisanos was delicious. The Caesars salad was crisp and chilled  perfectly and the croutons were soft and heated. The chicken dish I chose was terrific. And the service was outstanding as well.,Paisano's,132 Park Ave
45326,144,180,Italian,5,05/26/2021,"Coronavirus: 5/5  The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted nearly every corner of the world. But not Paisano’s in Rutherford. Contact-free menus were accessible by scanning a barcode on the camera app on both Android & Apple phones. All staff took safety precautions with gloves, masks, and social distancing. Tables were very spread apart and servers/hosts took appropriate measures to make guests feel safe and comfortable.    Service: 5/5  The hostess named Mireille, who should be on America’s Next Top Model, smoothly checked us into our reservation and seated us immediately. Our server, Nick, went above and beyond with his hospitality, describing the specials, making recommendations upon request, and checking on us periodically. The bussers made sure we had ample bread/oil and refilled our glasses. Even when it started raining during our outdoor dinner experience, they were prepared- giving us extra napkins & to-go boxes. I was very impressed with the team of staff; the whole dining experience was exceptional because of the way we were treated.    Food: 5/5  Calamari was cooked perfectly and was a nice portion for two. The steak I had on Nick’s recommendation was a very generous size & cooked just the way I requested.

We arrived to celebrate a birthday and brought our own cake, which they charged us 3 dollars per slice of the cake and had the audacity to keep the cake afterward.

The restaurant occupies the first floor of a house with a small parking lot.  The dining area is small with 7 or 8 tables but the ambiance is pleasant and soothing.  The staff were attentive and polite.  The menu has a nice mix of Italian dishes including pasta dishes, full entrees and pizzas.  We went there for lunch and had the sausage pizza and bacon pappardelle which were both delicious.  We finished our meal with the apricot bread pudding which was also amazing.

The ambiance is very chic yet comfortable, perfect for date night, girls night and even large groups. They have plenty of seating offering indoor and outdoor seating.    The service was great- our server was attentive, knowledgeable and friendly. She really went out of her way to make sure you were receiving 5 star service.    The food left the most impression on me, bound to please the most demanding taste buds. To start, we shared grilled feta topped with olive oil, roasted peepers, green onion and olives. I really loved the combination of the saltiness to this dish. We also shared the Mediterranean octopus, a healthy pile of potatoes under a perfectly chard octopus. Perfection!    As entrees, we shared pappardelle Rustica, pasta bathed in a delicious marinara sauce topped with Parmesan flakes. The burrata and ox tail over pasta provided a forkful of savory flavor. Lastly, we shared the the expresso braised short ribs accompanied by mash potatoes and veggies. The short ribs were tender, juicy and had just the right spice. I dragged my fork through the sultry sauce with each bite.    Even though our bellies were full, I could not pass up on a tasty treat.

When I asked her why she did that her response was ""that's just how the waiting goes in this restaurant"", when I asked her why you did you say you have a table available and confirmed my reservation, she said ""that's how it is you have to keep waiting"".

Having eaten at some of the best restaurants in both Hoboken and Manhattan I can say with confidence that this place is top notch. I've already been twice and both times the food was fantastic. Be ready for a ton of choices, the list of daily specials is longer than the substantial regular menu. The ambiance is great, you can sit outside in either the front or the back of the restaurant. It's a big place and does a lot of 6+ parties so it can be a little loud. They also let you relax and enjoy your dinner. They never rush you out the door like some places.

Due to a food allergy we have been substituting the anchovy sauce on the spiedini due to the removal of mozzarella Carrozza with a different sauce. However a rude manager said that it can’t be done when we placed our recent order. For my daughters birthday she wanted her favorite meal and it was ruined because they couldn’t substitute a sauce. Instead of suggesting ordering it without the sauce the manager insisted that it is no longer made that way.

I ordered the Cesar salad with extra dressing and the pasta fagioli soup. Both were delicious! I only have a picture of the soup and bread because I ate all of the salad and forgot to take a picture!        Modern Restaurant and Lounge is long in history.  Starting out as Modern Restaurant & Pizzeria in 1987 off of Russell Avenue in New Rochelle, Modern became famous for its homemade Italian dinners and pasta dishes, as well as old fashioned brick oven pizza.  Even before that, the Modern name originally came from a bread company established in 1920.  Modern evolved into one of Westchester County’s first pizzerias and became a favorite spot for many Westchester residents to enjoy home-made food and great pizza in a casual, friendly environment. The tradition of the good, old fashioned taste of authentic Italian food and friendly service is what Modern has become known for.

I don't know what the future holds for us in returning to modern.,Modern Restaurant & Lounge,310 Huguenot St
45716,11,183,Italian,4,12/27/2022,"Great service and atmosphere but I was disappointed with the food.  I was told how great this place was and I didn't see it that way. For the money   which was kind of pricey, I feel it should have been much better. I was with a party of four and we all felt the same.",Modern Restaurant & Lounge,310 Huguenot St
45717,12,183,Italian,1,04/26/2023,"I made reservations for Easter Sunday. Two friends from out of town joined me. Raved about this place I'd eaten at for 30+ years. Was a buffet..my fault, I didn't know when making reservations. The food was not hot,  nor was it the quality id become accustomed to.  The waitress had to be chased on several occasions to give us what we needed. Waited 45 minutes for our bill. $70.00 per person including tax and tip. Waitress did not deserve a $33.00 tip. I'm embarrassed. They lost a long time customer. Shame on them.",Modern Restaurant & Lounge,310 Huguenot St
45718,13,183,Italian,5,12/27/2022,Went on thanksgiving. They had a $50 dollar per person fee for an open buffet. The food was not good. Many dishes were cold. I still had a great time. Oh their pie was really good.,Modern Restaurant & Lounge,310 Huguenot St
45719,14,183,Italian,5,04/26/2023,Had a very nice dinner with my wife here recently. My wife had the chicken marsala and I had an individual size pizza. Both were very tasty. Our waitress Maggie was friendly and efficient. All and all a good meal.,Modern Restaurant & Lounge,310 Huguenot St
45720,15,183,Italian,4,01/26/2023,"We had our grandson's Christening party at Modern yesterday. The room on the left of the restaurant was perfect. The food was delicious and the staff were wonderful. My only complaint was the leak from the ceiling. They did put a rug down on the wooden floor, but having drops of water falling on my shoulder was disconcerting and a distraction while enjoying our meal. Besides this annoyance...the food was outstanding!",Modern Restaurant & Lounge,310 Huguenot St
45721,16,183,Italian,3,02/25/2023,Let me start off by saying I love modern food! I’m not here to judge the food but the portion sizes. I’ve notice that the take out menu portions are ridiculously small. They are charging more for less and it’s not right.,Modern Restaurant & Lounge,310 Huguenot St
45722,17,183,Italian,5,01/26/2023,I've been eating here when they were on Drake avenue... and they moved to Huge not!  My sister actually set up to have my birthday spent here about 5 years ago everything was excellent and we still order and eat there.,Modern Restaurant & Lounge,310 Huguenot St
45723,18,183,Italian,5,03/27/2023,"Had a great time. The calamari appetizer was very fresh and tender, pizza was delicious. Service was superb - they went above and beyond for us.",Modern Restaurant & Lounge,310 Huguenot St
45724,19,183,Italian,1,02/25/2023,I called for my pick up order at 6:25 so they said 20 to 25 minutes. I went there at 7 o’clock and I had to wait until 725. I wouldn’t mind the wait if the food was good but I was very disappointed. I’ve been ordering fettuccine carbonara from here since they were on Russell Avenue. They gave me over cooked pasta. Also the meal had no taste and barely any bacon I thought they gave me fettuccine Alfredo by mistake. There was two teeny tiny pieces of bacon in it I could hardly see it. I have always loved their fried calamari it’s always cooked to perfection. Not today it wasn’t. It wasn’t rubbery but the outside was soggy. A couple of years ago I had the same problem with the fettuccine carbonara it was over cooked and I hate overcooked macaroni. I called the restaurant and they told me they would bring me another one and I told them don’t worry about it because I don’t like sending food back to a restaurant. I’m afraid that they are going to do something to it. So I  ordered this dish once since I got the over cooked one a couple of years ago.. I just can’t believe they gave me over cooked macaroni again. When I complained a couple of years ago the man that answered said he didn’t want to lose me as a customer so they didn’t lose me as a customer. I wasn’t looking for a free meal. After today I will never order from them again. I am in my 50s and this is the first restaurant that I’ve ever gotten over cooked macaroni from and it happened twice.I took a picture of tonight’s fettuccine carbonara but there’s no option to leave a photo.,Modern Restaurant & Lounge,310 Huguenot St
45725,20,183,Italian,4,05/05/2023,Delicious Italian food.  The antipasto is made the way family used to make it with classic meats and cheese and peppers and olives.

45729,24,183,Italian,5,11/27/2022,I was surprised to find you could watch football here on Sunday. Great place to do so considering their brunch at just 32 per person. I ordered from the menu and had the Lobster ravioli. Amazing! The service was professional and top notch. If you like wine the by the glass options are nothing to write home about but the bottle list is more than serviceable. Parking is not an issue as there is a valet. I recommend this place if you are accustomed to a comfortable upscale environment.,Modern Restaurant & Lounge,310 Huguenot St

The desserts though were great (see photo)!!. In general I liked the restaurant and the atmosphere very much.,Modern Restaurant & Lounge,310 Huguenot St

The staff was very accommodating (they seated us in a booth!) and even gave us a complimentary dessert for our anniversary. The cocktails were excellent. I loved the Japanese Old Fashioned.

The server took our order, then never checked on us. Drinks were empty and never refilled. Was quick to take the check though.... would we go back...nope. For the ones that say it's amazing- maybe we had a bad experience, or maybe they need to get out more to restaurants that are actually good and worth the price.",Modern Restaurant & Lounge,310 Huguenot St

Very odd I may say for a restaurant that looks like fine dining. Second, the food was sub par. Chiken parm tasted very generic like it was frozen and heated up. The bake ziti was over cooked and tasted bland. For what I experienced the bill at the end is insane! Too much money for sub par food and experience.",Modern Restaurant & Lounge,310 Huguenot St

45767,63,183,Italian,2,05/26/2022,"I have to be brutally honest  Here. I went to this restaurant for my birthday I chose it myself  Based on the reviews, but the 4 stars reviews are not a reflection of what I experienced. First off the Valet was on point and we were all seated pretty promptly once we arrived .  The 1st impression once we sat down was  Not good. So the the man that brought our water placed it on the table did not make any eye contact did not say a word and walked off. Then someone came over and brought bread said absolutely nothing put it down on the table and walked off no hello how are you absolutely nothing. I have never experienced this in a restaurant before it was very rude. The waitress finally came over and she was a breath of fresh air very pleasant but didn't know much about the food or the wine list. She couldn't make any suggestions about the menu when asked.  A couple of us had chicken Francese and some had salmon the food was not good no flavor pasta not done right I have never had such bad chicken Francese seriously lacking... So was the salmon very bland. Besides the food being a poor Representation of Italian food they they charge 3% if fee if you use a credit card to buy dinner...I've been to a lot of restaurants and I have not heard of this? Is this something new ?it's crazy who walks around with a load of cash to purchase dinner ?most people use credit card to purchase their dinners. So taxes ,tip and now you want to charge people for using a credit card.From the outside this place looks really nice but the ambiance inside is not flattering  it's just something grim about the place I don't like the lighting. But that's just me. Definitely will not return here I'll stick to Pelham or White Plains for great Italian restaurants and of course The Bronx.",Modern Restaurant & Lounge,310 Huguenot St

I had a dirty martini and must say i was only going to have 2 but had 4. I had the gnocchi with the meat sauce it was a bit underwhelming. Lacked flavor.

Once in a while we got something that wasn't up to par -- like chewy baked clams -- but that was rare and didn't stop us from patronizing the restaurant. Since they moved we have been there a few times. The ambiance is really lovely and spacious -- a totally different experience. It is now the kind of place you can bring people to celebrate something -- I had my husband's 65th birthday there. I brought my own cake and the server did it up right! Very nice servers and staff. The food is still good but not 5 star.",Modern Restaurant & Lounge,310 Huguenot St
45792,88,183,Italian,5,05/26/2022,"Modern was such an amazing establishment very attentive and the service was very on point. They were super accommodating and understanding with me. The appetizers,entrees, and dessert were all delicious. I went with fettuccine carbonara with shrimp.All of my friends loved there meals which made me happy to know that they were enjoying a place I picked.

45793,89,183,Italian,5,05/26/2020,"I didn't realize my typed review didn't save. Soooo! If you are looking for an evening of amazing food, low key atmosphere, and friendly/warm environment, then quit your search and just go here. Good craft beer, phenomenal food, and great service. The worst part of my evening is debating which plate I wanted to eat. WARNING : Their bread appetizer is more filling than you'd think. 3+ people you're safe (unless you love bread then FORGET THEM!) A++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Get that garlic bread... It's insane. Cheers",Modern Restaurant & Lounge,310 Huguenot St
45794,90,183,Italian,1,05/27/2019,"I got sick from the Tartar appetizer I ordered last night. I'd advise them to be more careful how they handle food and utensils.  There was a waitress who let  3 or 4 sets of silverware fall on the dirty floor,  picked them up and put them together with the cleaned ones without any shame. I told the waiter what I saw,  he forwarded my message to their manager who very professionally tried to resolve these 2 issues. This restaurant has a nice ambiance, I wish no one  goes through this experience. You go out to have fun NOT to get sick :(",Modern Restaurant & Lounge,310 Huguenot St

45796,93,183,Italian,3,05/26/2022,"The manager was rude & very condescending with a new  business opening in the area. Jokingly we said;; "" It's a celebration, the start of a new business in the area, we should have a free celebratory shot.""His response was you should know better than to ask that of a manager, but you'll learn"" Excuse me? Definitely not recommending this place to our customers. Thank you!",Modern Restaurant & Lounge,310 Huguenot St
45797,94,183,Italian,5,05/27/2019,"I eat at this place from time to time when I'm in the New Rochelle area and they never let me down with regard to the quality of food and their service.  I'll also mention the atmosphere as the restaurant itself, is well decorated and large enough to where you're not crammed together with other people while eating. Finally, I'll mention the bar, which is welcoming and where you will be served by bartenders that are professionals.",Modern Restaurant & Lounge,310 Huguenot St
45798,95,183,Italian,1,05/26/2021,"If there were an option for 0 stars, I'd use it sans hesitation.    When COVID-19 hit and we made deliberate efforts to support the businesses that we liked, we made the sad mistake of ordering from Modern.    The food was over 30 minutes late. We called to inquire.    Dragon lady on the phone cut me off and would not even let me ask a question. We asked for a manager to be chewed out by someone in the back saying they've been here for 20 years. We were told we could expect another call from another manager since the one of the phone clearly didn't care.    It has been 5 weeks.    The food was also awful. We had to throw it away.    That was the last time we will be eating there.    Word to the wise: keep your word to your customers.",Modern Restaurant & Lounge,310 Huguenot St

The place is usually packed, and for good reason - the food is amazing! I usually try Chicken Parmesan at every Italian restaurant I go to, and this is my absolute favorite. My husband always gets the Pork Chop Contadina, and he loves that too. Everything else we have had there is delicious too.

Called at 1:30pm on Thanksgiving to confirm everything was in order. I was told yes. Turns out they charged my debit card at 12:11pm. The food was not delivered at or close to 2PM.

45811,108,183,Italian,5,05/27/2019,"We have ALWAYS enjoyed the dining and amenities at Modern! But on this particular day, the staff went far above and beyond their regular services.    My sister had planned an outdoor celebration for my nephew's high school graduation.  She went all out - hiring everyone from a landscaper to a food truck! On the day of the event (May 23, 2019), all preparations were in place for a wonderful party...or so we thought. The event was due to begin at 6pm. The panic began to set in about 5ish, when the food truck did not appear. My sister made a phone call to the business, and to her horror, was told that they had the wrong date!!! They were not expecting to arrive until the next day!!    With my sister in a full-on state of devastation, she managed to make her way to Modern to see if there was any way they could help her with this fiasco. Despite the fact that the restaurant was packed with families also celebrating graduations, the take-out staff went to work!! A half an hour later, the amazing Modern staff had pulled together enough food to serve 50 people; including salads, sandwiches, pizzas, and hot pasta dishes!!!    Mere words are just not enough to express our overwhelming gratitude!!! BRAVO! Modern, for swooping in and saving the day!!!!",Modern Restaurant & Lounge,310 Huguenot St

If you are in the mood to try something new and different, this is the place to go.  Each drink recipe is carefully designed and tested and the drink menu is updated for each season.  It is fun watching the bartender since he puts so much care and attention into making each drink. The food is also delicious-I especially love the shrimp oreganata (which is not technically on the menu, but they always make it, no problem).",Modern Restaurant & Lounge,310 Huguenot St

45814,111,183,Italian,5,05/27/2018,This is a great Italian restaurant. The food is great and the menu is very well rounded so there is something for everyone. The decor is pleasing and the general feel is inviting. The bar is long so plenty of room to get a drink. They do have a few private rooms for your events. One issue is parking. They do have a valet but other then that it is on street metered parking.,Modern Restaurant & Lounge,310 Huguenot St

There are always daily specials to share before enjoying a menu pick for an entree. The professional staff takes care to ensure each order is served as requested,  No reservations needed, we are at home having our meal at the bar, where it is so entertaining to people watch or engage with our bartender if it is not too busy + we really have gotten to know them over the years and appreciate them more.  They are a hard working, talented, professional and friendly bar tending staff that are so good at making a great cocktail! Oh, the desserts are wonderful too.

45820,117,183,Italian,5,05/27/2018,"We’ve been going to Modern for a couple years now. Food and service always great. Decided to have my husband’s 50th Birthday dinner there. Because we were 20 people, I had to select from a pre-fixed menu and service was family style.  I was very concerned that we didn’t have the flexibility to just order from the menu, but was assured that this way would be better.  I have to say the food-as always- was amazing.  There was so much too! On top of that Modern provided pizza for the kids and my niece who has a gluten and dairy allergy picked what she wanted from the menu and they ensured the food met her allergy needs.  That’s a huge deal because I never want her to feel excluded and not many places can accommodate the way Modern was able to. You will always be my go to place! Thank you to Maggie who helped me with the menu and to Sarah who was attentive throughout the night. You guys are great!",Modern Restaurant & Lounge,310 Huguenot St
45821,118,183,Italian,1,05/26/2021,Waited 2 hours for Thanksgiving dinner to go.  We placed the order days in advance. Completely unacceptable!  They took too many orders and made a great day very stressful.   Sorry does not help. They took the money with no thought about actually delivering on their promise. Lost my business forever.,Modern Restaurant & Lounge,310 Huguenot St
45822,119,183,Italian,4,05/28/2015,"Recently had the opportunity to drop in to the Modern for a quick bite. I was pleasantly surprised to find a comfy, casual atmosphere that almost made me feel like I was not in New Rochelle, but in the city at one of those well established family style places. The chicken cutlet parm and the mussels marinara were very good. Service was okay and the prices are a bit higher than I would expect in this area, but well worth it. I would either visit or order to go with no problem.",Modern Restaurant & Lounge,310 Huguenot St
45823,120,183,Italian,2,05/26/2020,"Firstly I’ll start by saying the food was really good. The reason I’m giving them 2 stars was due to the service. My husband and I were on a very long road trip and stopped here to grab some food as they had gluten free options and I have celiacs so I’m very limited to where we can eat. We had been traveling all day so of course we are in comfy clothes. I feel like we were judged on our appearances which is a shame as we are generous tippers. They switched servers after taking our order, we assumed her shift was ending (it was not busy) and she was still serving the table next to us. Our new server came up to us once after our appetizers came out and we didn’t see her again. I had to go and ask someone for the manager to come to our table. When he arrived I asked for the check, boxes and explained what happened. The manager did apologize for the wait however that wasn’t good enough as we were treated poorly. The only people who I believe did a great job and was very tentative was the gentlemen refilling our drinks and the food runner. Some advice for the staff and management; people are paying for a full service so treat them respectfully, don’t judge a book by its cover even if its wearing a Beavis and Butthead Teeshirt!!!!",Modern Restaurant & Lounge,310 Huguenot St

45827,125,183,Italian,2,05/27/2019,"I've been here three times and each time there is a problem with the food order, horrible service, or both. I am starting to feel that this establishment only treats a certain patron well; unfortunately I do not fit the profile.    The food is ok at best. But for the price and service I would most definitely go somewhere else.    The servers literally try to avoid you while pandering to other guests. But they sure hang around when you get the check (so they can see how much you tip). They bring out the wrong food and try to charge you for it (fortunately we got the bill adjusted with little issue). No refill on drinks. No one takes away the bread basket or appetizer plates before the food comes out. They do not offer things like fresh cracked pepper, ect like they do to other patrons. You definitely feel different and unwelcomed.    I will not be returning. I spent my money here three times and left feeling irritated and unhappy EACH time. Servers and staff need training on how to treat ALL patrons well. Not just the ones they think tip well...",Modern Restaurant & Lounge,310 Huguenot St

The finest caterer could not have provided a more, personal and customized party, with a delectable array of fine Italian foods that was more than adequate (we came home with doggie bags). We had a simple, but beautiful dining room, the service was elegant and attentive, guests were handled as valuable clients, parking was valet and all while the main restaurant was filled to capacity.

We will definitely be coming back next weekend and every weekend after that. The service was amzing thanks to our waitress and others that helped. The food came fast and hot! Also the valets were a great pleasure to have. My wife and I had door to door service in the rain. These delightful young gentlemen held the door open for us and greeted us instantly. One of them even went above and beyond to help my wife into our car without getting her hair wet. Some of the BEST valet service I have ever had in my enitre life.

Bar area sufficient, wait staff/ service awesome, plenty of good choices off menu and wine menu extensive, although on a Friday night at peak we waited alot longer for entrees than to be expected. Value of dollar for food could be better. Salmon entree for $23 was disappointing (size & amount on plate) as were a few appetizers coming up short in volume. So, always ASK QUESTIONS!  I had Chicken Scarpariello, was supposed to be with chunks of chicken and sausage, but sausage and potatoes delivered in dish were really small slivers. Sides of pasta or salads served with entrees could have been a little more generous too as was serving of breads. Now how much more would that cost them?? Overall experience was good. Go back?

We have never gone wrong with any of these choices.",Modern Restaurant & Lounge,310 Huguenot St
45848,146,183,Italian,4,05/27/2019,"I used to visit Modern almost weekly, until early 2018. I was dissatisfied at the time with the Client Service, and so I ""pulled away"" for a while...I needed some space. I'm a true believer in keeping the Client's needs top of mind, and I didn't feel as if the Restaurant's Management was doing so....but I believe they have now improved their mindset.  The food is consistently good....my friend likes their pizza, and some of the appetizer and dinner specials (which they have daily). I, personally, like their Fra Diavolo sauce over Meatballs. The Meatballs are Large, don't have a lot of filler, and are good with a side of fresh Ricotta (though you won't finish the ricotta). Also, the Bartender, Eric, now has a much nicer ""pour"" than when I was previously a weekly regular.  The ambience is cozy, and traditional with a mid-century vibe. We normally sit at the bar, which has a hardwood bar top and barstools, as well as several bar booths with leather seating.  There is rarely a wait because they've got lots of seating. The bar is separated from the main dining area, so it feels separate, which I like because that way, you dont have to be disturbed by families with little children, although, I have rarely seen children there when I'm there (makes sense since it's usually Wednesday evenings after my Yoga workout).  Check it out ",Modern Restaurant & Lounge,310 Huguenot St
45849,147,183,Italian,5,05/27/2018,Fantastic Thanksgiving dinner.  Felt like I was in someone's home and everything was home made.  Service was also terrific.

45855,153,183,Italian,1,05/27/2019,"Not welcoming or inviting. When I initially walked in a waitress looked at me as if I was a delivery person, I stated I wanted a table the hostess was sitting down all the way in the back of the restaurant, I was under impression the hostess is supposed to be standing at the podium to greet you. Then I get seated. In an area where the other patrons were on the opposite side of the Restaraunt. Then once served was never checked on or asked anything regarding my food. The Restaraunt was primarily empty so I was confused as to why I was not receiving any attention from my server. A glass of water was poured, my glass was empty never refilled and plates were left on the table for a while. At the end of this horrible dining experience, the server sent another, waiter over to finish out and I asked him for more water which I never received. The sad thing is that the food was good from what I tasted. I took my entree to go, because I could not sit and receive such poor service any longer. Then this took the cake. As I was exiting the Restaraunt, hostess said Good Bye, while all the employees said nothing. First and last time will not be returning nor recommending to anyone. I kind of feel like it was a little discriminatory behavior taking place.",Modern Restaurant & Lounge,310 Huguenot St

It made us wonder if they served the salmon as pieces in a pasta dish to hide that it wasn’t as fresh as it should be. The fish special shouldn’t make you sick.,Modern Restaurant & Lounge,310 Huguenot St

They have a Italian combo on the menu but the waitress couldn't tell me anything special about it like ""the meat comes from a famous deli in Arthur ave in the BX"" & ""it's topped with sharp provolone imported from italy"". I mean for the price what makes this Italian combo special from any corner deli?  I heard good things about this place and all I saw was generic over priced Italian food that I can get any where.  If that's what you want or if your just looking to go to the new trendy spot then this is the spot.  Very disappointed.",Modern Restaurant & Lounge,310 Huguenot St
45864,162,183,Italian,1,05/26/2021,"This is the second time ordering from this facade of a restaurant. The time first was a flavourless clams, garlic and white wine pasta dish. I actually appreciated the clean nature of the dish, but it literally had zero taste. This time was fettucini carbonara; not only did the order take an 1 1/2 to arrive (ordered 12:27, delivered 1:55), the dish was horrible, also zero flavour, no care or proper prep involved in preparing the fatty Shop Rite bacon and curdled blobs of Carbonara sauce mushed into poor quality pasta. Granted, mushy perhaps due to travel/delivery time, but absolutely unacceptable across the board. ~ Thank you kindly, however, the employee who took the call and to whom I respectfully explained the issue, was not at all receptive, in fact, argued the point defensively repeatedly placing us on hold only to come back to argue the delivery time after arguing the taste of dish. I very much appreciate your response, thank you.",Modern Restaurant & Lounge,310 Huguenot St

It's by far, one of the very best Italian restaurants in the entire County, if not further. It NEVER fails to serve you the freshest, most delicious meals. I'm a huge fan of their Chicken and Veal Marsala and Francese...I decided to try their Shrimp Francese for a change of pace. Sure, Ive had many meals at many Italian restaurants in the ""world famous Little Italy"" sections of NY City...I have to honestly say, this was the absolute BEST dish Ive ever had the pleasure of enjoying. Coupled with the Linguine with REAL White Clam Sauce, which in itself was phenomenal, as well as a salad with Gorgonzola cheese that was spectacular. I had the pleasure of returning again just a few short weeks later, and politely told the waitress (who's service was fabulous) thay I didnt even need a menu....  Modern has been around for a LONG TIME. Originally, you felt like uou were sitting in the basement of a friend's home, and the food was just beyond incredible. Now, in the newer location the only thing thats changed is the size. The food has gotten even better (tough to believe since it already was EXCELLENT. The great service, the way they make you feel like family, and the food continues to be incredible....Wherever you are, if you're planning on being near Nrw Rochelle....Modern is DEFINITELY a place you cant pass by.....ENJOY !!!!!! You'll be planning your next visit before you even finish your meal  5 out of 5 Stars EVERY TIME !!!   !!!!",Modern Restaurant & Lounge,310 Huguenot St

I paid my bill and immediately never wanted to return to this poor excuse of an establishment.... no manager came over to even ask what had happened, etc.... I truly advise everyone to stay away if good service is what you’re looking for.... there is absolutely nothing that can be done to change my mind.... The best thing to happen was not receive a new sandwich because the veal was tough, and mediocre anyways. Thanks for leaving a bad taste in my mouth, and soda stains on a 95$ shirt....

45874,172,183,Italian,5,05/26/2020,"One month to this date I had planned the perfect celebration for my son who was graduating from Iona Prep and continuing his education at Iona College. Since his birthday was days away I had decided to do a Graduation/Birthday Celebration at home on our fabulously manicured lawn with all burgundy and gold flowers translation deep red and yellow which are Iona's school colors.    Please let me set up the seen The property can be accessed from the front and back of the house. I shut off the back carport to house the wonderful food truck that I had ordered and paid for in full. Remember the word ""FOOD TRUCK!"" All of my 100 guest which included family and friends would come to graduation and then casually walk 1 block to the back yard party of life! Of course those who did not make it to graduation would definitely be at the after party celebration. As you come in through the front of the house you were greeted by 11 lawn size photo's of my son with 20 burgundy and gold balloons floating above, strategic path to backyard with a white tent, tables and chairs dressed to perfection and to top it all off the best porta-potty ever! That's right I said, ""Porta-Potty!""    Anywho!  I waited and lingered at the graduation site because I wanted my guest to be floored by the decorations and of course the food truck that would be cooking and servicing my guest from soup to nuts. And when I say soup to nuts I mean vegan, vegetarian, hot dogs, grilled chicken and of course my son's favorite cheese burgers (All he can eat) which also included all garnishing and paper goods.    I drive up to the back of the house with 2 of my guest in the car to what?  NO FOOD TRUCK  ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND 100 HUNGRY GUEST!    I asked my 2 guest to enjoy the party as I drove away in shock and numb. I felt like I had instantly had a heart attack. On the speaker phone in my car calm but hysterical with the food truck company asking what the heck happen?    I drove up to MODERN RESTAURANT got out of the car phone in one hand swollen face trying to explain to MODERN'S manager and owner what was happening but nothing was coming out. The manager, Scot took me by my hand and said please stop crying and tell me what you need. Never-the-less 30 minutes later 6 boxes of cheese and salad pizza, salad, dressing, vegetable pasta, hot bread, baked-ziti, Italian hero and cheese burger sliders!  Did I say in 30 MINUTES!  Not to mention plates silverware, racks and Sterno!    30 MINUTES WITH A PACKED RESTAURANT!    They had sent the food with 2 family members, looked at me and said, ""You want a drink?"" of course I don't drink, ""I replied no."" The owner said do me a favor go to the restroom, wash your face and go enjoy the party your guest are already eating!

The bar is separated from the 2 dining areas and also has some booths if you choose to eat while watching sporting events. Parking is the only issue as it is surrounded by residential buildings and there is no dedicated parking lot.,Barcelona's Restaurant & Bar,38 Harrison Ave

47229,17,192,Italian,2,10/28/2022,"Sunday,,  my husband n 2 friends came to eat at Barcelonas. We were sitted in front by the bar because there was a party going on in the back room. We ordered antipasto which we have had before but this time it was very skimpy. There were 2 or 3 slices of meat n cheese,  some olives, a few tomato slices,  n and some small hot peppers to decorate the dish.  We then ordered for meatballs. They were terrible. They were mostly bread n maybe a handful of chop meat mixed in the whole batter. All were cut in half n smothered in sauce to camouflage the bread balls. We also got a pizza which was good as always. Then I was shocked when I ordered an eggplant parm sandwich to go. When I opened it there were delicious breaded eggplant cutlets , a slice of cheese n a spoon full of sauce only on top. There was no sauce on the cutlets in between the bread or cutlets. What a disappointment! If they ran out of sauce for the  eggplants or chop meat for the meatballs they should have told us n we would have ordered something different. After all these years of eating there n n bragging how good the food was there we were quite embarrassed  by bringing our dear friends out for a delicious lunch n receiving this mess. No more Barcelona for us from now on we will  go to Pizzatown, The Firehouse on Plauderville Ave or ROSAS Pizza on River Road. Hopefully one day we hear Barcelona hired a professional Chef that knows how cook real Italian food like they use to before. So sad n disappointed.  PLEASE DONT LET BARCELONA 'S REPUTATION GO DOWN THE TUBES. .",Barcelona's Restaurant & Bar,38 Harrison Ave

The pizza was okay, but our kids both didn't like it. The waitress was standoffish and ignored my pleas for water. A cook told us over the phone that the place was full but it was empty when we got there. We did get our food ridiculously fast! It was impressive! And it was pretty decent. I would like to go again soon.",Barcelona's Restaurant & Bar,38 Harrison Ave

47243,31,192,Italian,2,05/26/2022,"Food quality: 2/5  I ate here with my family. I review quite a lot of places and despite the absolutely LOYAL Customers this restaurant has. The praise based on praises due to price, portions, and atmosphere I can see why they have a growing fan base. I came to this restaurant with an extremely high bar and was overwhelmingly let down. A chicken parm, a shrimp parm that was more cheese and breading than actual chicken and shrimp. They should include a photo on the menu that would show actual sizes. I ask myself, why spend nearly 45$ on 2 dishes that lacked the main ingredient?  I eat at all starred restaurants and I call balls and strikes as I see them.  Pay the extra 10$ and go to a better quality environment    Service:  Again nothing personal. We asked for some water. I guess they forgot?  It didn't look all that busy either... I can't imagine this place during a busy dinner cycle.    The bar tender was awesome and he earned my 1 star rating. He was very respectful.    Maybe this was an off night. I don't think I'll ever return.",Barcelona's Restaurant & Bar,38 Harrison Ave

47255,44,192,Italian,5,05/26/2021,"The first time I was here I paused before going in because of the look of the place from the outside.  It's an older building and to say it could use some updating is an understatement.    However, some of the best places I've been have been little hole in the wall type places.    Well I wasn't disappointed that I walked in here.  The food and service were great.  Highly recommended.",Barcelona's Restaurant & Bar,38 Harrison Ave

47259,48,192,Italian,5,05/26/2020,Haven't been here in twenty years and the place didnt change either. But to my amazement ordered the pizza and it tastes as good as it did twenty years ago.

47261,50,192,Italian,4,05/26/2021,"If you don't already know about Barcelona's then you just don't know Barcelona's. A Garfield institution since the 30's its old school and unpretentious. The 90 cent meatball hero I enjoyed back in high school is now a whopping $4.50 40 years later. And it's still good, the pizza is in a class of its own and has been a ""Barcey's"" pie since time immortal, super thin, cheesy cut into 16 slices you just eat and eat. Old time bar, easy on the wallet carafe's of wine, pitchers of beer....Mussels, fried ravioli and Pizza are usually the go-to's the entrees (shrimp scampi) cost less than Diner prices, but this is a tried and true Italian restaurant that has been doing its thing for 80 years.

We've been here twice in the past year when visiting family and both times have been great.  I didn't give it 5 stars for this second visit because the waitress was a bit unfriendly and the garlic bread was overcooked and didn't have nearly the garlic I remember from the first visit.  Nonetheless, I plan to go back and I look forward to more spaghetti, pizza, and Italian cold cuts.",Barcelona's Restaurant & Bar,38 Harrison Ave

Why some places go to the trouble of crisply cooking the chicken breast,  only to destroy that crispness by drowning it sauce & cheese, I'll never know.  Not here. At Barcelona's the parm (off menu) was a standout. The lasagna, meatloaf & pizza were no slouches either.    Eat here, you won't regret it. Cash only.",Barcelona's Restaurant & Bar,38 Harrison Ave

47273,63,192,Italian,1,05/27/2016,"This place has very low quality generic food that is primarily all frozen, except of course the pizza, which they make (but is nothing special the crust has no taste). My son ordered chicken soup which you can tell came right out of the can. The fried calamari you could tell was purchased frozen and just deep fried, as was the fried shrimp. (You can tell they just purchase it frozen and drop it in the deep fryer - nothing is freshly made) it's like going to Seaside heights and eating boardwalk food - if that's what you're into then knock yourself out - spend a little more and you can get ""real food"" from a real restaurant - I will never go there again  P.S.

47282,72,192,Italian,1,05/27/2019,"What a joke of a restaurant. First of all, the place is cash only (hello, it's 2018 now) and many a customer have gone away disappointed because of it!    The food is such a disappointment. The pizza has TOO much of everything. Crust is soggy and undercooked. Sauce is too salty. Too much cheese. This place is serving up Americanized garbage. Just because it's cheap doesn't mean you're getting value for your money. You may as well be eating cup noodles and lunchables. Take your patronage and your money to one of the fantastic, fresh pizzerias in the area and spend a little more for much greater food.    And the ATMOSPHERE. Talk about stuck in the 1950's. The red and white checker print is burned into your brain never to leave. It's like a scene from the worst cheesy mob movie you've ever seen. I almost can't believe this place is still in business. But, what surprises me even more is that most of their customers seem to think this food is good.    EVERYTHING in this restaurant needs an update, the food being the first. It actually disgusts me that everything tastes like it's a week old and came out of a can. Frozen pizza is better than the pizza here and I deeply regret giving my money to people who sell this garbage and call it Italian food!",Barcelona's Restaurant & Bar,38 Harrison Ave

I wanted to order a tiramisu but they were frozen so couldn’t be sold one. Menu was disgusting.  Honestly it looks like management doesn’t pay attention to anything, as we have not even once seen a manager even pass by. Anyway, if they can get their cleaning down and work as a team, place could really be great like it is supposed to be",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,200 Baychester Ave Suite 208A

My husband and I ordered the Pasta Carbona, the chicken parmigiana, the mozzarella sticks, chicken soup, and the tiramisu. It was completely amazing . I highly recommend trying the Olive Garden in Baychester.  The waitress who took care of us was also a super star. We couldn’t have had such a great experience if it wasn’t for our server.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,200 Baychester Ave Suite 208A

The restaurant was clean and staff and waitress were nice.    Here is a few things they need to work on. Customer service skills need work. I had to ask for water FOUR times. They ran out of Iced Tea but yet the waitress did not offer anything or got me interested to buy any other drink. Did not asked me if I wanted a dessert neither suggested any appetizers.    The staff can perform great if their people skills are polished. By doing this the staff can get more tips, better reviews and create a better over all experience for the customer.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,200 Baychester Ave Suite 208A
48221,10,197,Italian,2,02/25/2023,"The waiter was nice and very courteous. Since the salad was first thing to come out it was unappealing.

I told my server my steak came out medium done instead of medium rare  she spoke to the manager and he came to my table instantly.  He really was apologetic and wanted to help make my experience a good one. He took off the steak and even offered a dessert. I was surprised but very satisfied and they really do deserve the 5 stars not because he took the steak off but because his customer service was excellent and I appreciate it very much .,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,200 Baychester Ave Suite 208A

It was a little wait so things were starting off on the wrong foot at first but then we all left with a great impression! I have to commend the gentleman in the front desk. He was very hospitable, super professional, and really went out of his way to accommodate us! My mom was a little frustrated so she wanted to leave but he convinced us to stay and later brought us our drinks until our waiter came. Thanks Antony!!!  Food was good and so was presentation. The drinks were good too.  Customer service was great for being in the Bronx lol . I’ll probably come back again. ",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,200 Baychester Ave Suite 208A

Our server Demetrius may have been the best waiter I've ever had in my life.  His attention to detail was exceptional. He made excellent recommendations and he was very attentive to our needs.  He was professional and kind.  He represented the brand well.  Olive Garden is lucky to have an employee like Demetrius who goes out of his way to keep the customer happy.  Thank you Demetrius for taking our dining experience to the next level.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,200 Baychester Ave Suite 208A
48228,17,197,Italian,2,04/26/2023,"It was overall just bad. The food was good which is the only reason it gets 2 stars. The customer service was horrible. A worker literally walked up to us and said what’s good and left. We felt like we were ignored the whole time we were there, as I asked for water first thing and never get one. I left in a worst mood than when I got there. On top of that, it’s the second time I go there and we don’t have utensil’s, we literally had to wait for a worker to cross or walk up to them to get something. Mind you, there weren’t many people there, many desks and chairs were open, so there is no excuse.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,200 Baychester Ave Suite 208A
48229,18,197,Italian,1,11/27/2022,My experience was poor. This is the second time I try this place and it's the same. Children were running around. People were soliciting.

Told us she was in the back baking bread and she had more tables to service. Families that walked in after us were already eating. The waiter then proceeded to catch a nasty attitude and walked away. Disgusting we had no plates the food was cold. Horrible service! Happy New Year,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,200 Baychester Ave Suite 208A

48233,22,197,Italian,4,03/27/2023,"The food was really good. It did take a little longer than I would've liked and it wasn't because we were just hungry bc we did have the bread to snack on, but the main course took a noticeable while, not ""mad"" long,  but that looking up every 30 secs looking wondering what's taking so long long. Other than that our waitress was pleasant and friendly even took a couple pictures for us. They Came out good by the way. There were enough ppl eating and enjoying their meals, family, couple, groups and that made for a good feeling of being ""out"" everything was nice and clean as well.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,200 Baychester Ave Suite 208A
48234,23,197,Italian,5,05/19/2023,"The food was decent, rates fine, but what makes a restaurant is its service.  Morgan, our young server, is nothing short of phenomenal.  As an ambassador with over 30 years of service to royalty, heads of state, ministers, ambassadors,  etc., she took care of my birthday cake, asked if I would be embarrassed by the display and then taking care of my coffee and way too much sugar, went and found some small Olive Garden chocolates to give me. It is that level of consideration, humility, and grace that makes staff great managers.  I would put her on my private staff. Darden, note your diamond in the rough. Brava Morgan!",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,200 Baychester Ave Suite 208A
48235,24,197,Italian,3,05/26/2020,"I have been to this location several times but I never got the chance to review it up close. Today, I went with my family during its closing time on Monday to be exact. There were both some pros and cons that were present tonight so let me start off positively. The most important aspect of any restaurant is great food and drinks. The food itself was very excellent and although there was one drink that didn't taste so well, the rest made up for it. Joanna was our waitress and she was very kind and patient with us. Her recommendations were awesome and when they got to our table, it proved every word she said about them.    Now come the unfortunate: cons. They say that the first impression determines your experience. That is only half true. The plates they gave us the first time were not properly washed. They did replace them and apologized which was good. I have heard that the restrooms were not any better so I went to investigate. The toilet was unsanitary and their soap dispensers was broken so I couldn't properly wash my hands. The place itself was empty during that time and I noticed that Joanna was the only one serving almost 10 tables by herself. Management didn't even step in to assist and one of the servers went to our table with the wrong order. How could you mess that up with so few customers present? Anyway, it wasn't fair to her but she said that she was ok.    To those who read this far, I am not sure if I should recommend this place. In the past, there were no problems at all. I don't understand why there were some tonight. However, that decision to come....I leave up to you.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,200 Baychester Ave Suite 208A
48236,25,197,Italian,4,04/26/2023,"This Olive Garden serves good food & have never had an issue with the waiters.

48237,26,197,Italian,1,05/26/2020,"I went with my friend on sat january 15 th and had to wait over an hour to be seated because there was a leak on the restaurant selling. They did not give us a buzzer so according to them after waiting an hour we were already called , then we had to wait another 30 minutes. The customer service was not good at all. We had to be calling the waitresses for everything we needed because they wouldn't check on us. I ordered a potato soup and it looks disgusting I didn't even try to eat it. And it was super watery. They really need to take potatoes soup out of their menu. Then we ordered pasta and it was ok. We had to call the waitress again to ask for cheese. The strawberry lemonade were very watered down and the bread was hard. I wouldnt recommend this specific location at all. The price was ok.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,200 Baychester Ave Suite 208A

She came around to ask if we were enjoying everything and she remembered to bring us more napkins and a cover for a little sauce cup from an order of zeppolis and made some small talk. She was full of smiles and was a pleasure to be around.

It's usually about 30 to 40 mins wait to get in, and why I gave 4 stars is due to the fact that it took about 45 mins to an hour before we got our food. The food was amazing by the way as you can see. Just did not enjoy how long I had to wait for it. Kool spot, nice environment. The servers are really kind and friendly.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,200 Baychester Ave Suite 208A

48249,38,197,Italian,2,05/26/2022,"""Happy Birthday,"" they sang - and brought out a piece of still-rock-hard-frozen pumpkin-flavored cheesecake with a candle on it.  It was a fun and unexpected surprise for my 40th birthday, that I didn't ask for.  And then I saw the $8.25 on my bill for it.  Really?    This was the tip of the iceberg for a dismal birthday dinner with 6 of my closest friends.  The server brought our drinks once, then disappeared for the rest of the meal.  She never once checked on us, refilled drinks or anything.  We could see her in the next dining room over, sitting at a table and counting her tips. My ""Chicken and Gnocchi"" soup had exactly one piece of chicken in it, and exactly zero gnocchi.  Trust me, I counted.    The icing on the proverbial birthday cake was when she brought the bill to me.  She stood next to me and hovered over me, close enough that her thigh was literally touching the back of my arm near the shoulder as if she was ""leaning"" into me.  She watched while I wrote the tip, then swiped the bill away as quickly as she had set it down.  Perhaps she was afraid we would not tip her, or not tip her well, because we were somewhat vocal during the meal about how terrible the service was - and I'll bet she could hear us from the next room over while she feverishly counted her tips.  Never in my life have I had a server stand over me and watch while I wrote and signed the bill.  My friends were dumbfounded.. and I was offended.    The ONLY bright spot -and the reason this review gets 2 stars instead of 1.. was the hostess at the front stand.  She was sweet enough that I remember her name - Katelynn.  She is an absolute treasure.  Friendly, charming and very quick with taking our reservation and finding us an available table.  Every time we interacted with Katelynn, it was a joy.  I wish Katelynn had been our server.  She is a model employee who should be used as an example of what everyone else should do.    I love Olive Garden as a chain.  I love the food.  But I have been to the Bay Plaza location time and again - and each time I walk out disappointed.  The food is okay (when you can actually get some chicken and gnocchi in your soup), but the service has repeatedly been a horrible miss.  Unfortunately I don't think I will be back.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,200 Baychester Ave Suite 208A

However, the chocolate cake they had for dessert was 9 dollars and change for a single slice. I was expecting a mini cake not a slice, but when I bite into the cake it was freaking amazing, and than I understood why that cake was so costly for a decent slice.  After eating that slice of cake, I only wish I had the whole cake to share with family and friends, literally next time I will definitely buy 8 slices instead of one, it's that amazing.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,200 Baychester Ave Suite 208A

It took 20 mins and two visits to the counter before someone acknowledged us. I had come to The Olive for the bread sticks(Golden Brown and soft)an was very disappointed. We were served overcooked and not so soft bread sticks. This is my second visit to this location and I am sure it'll be my last.

My wife and daughter and myself was served with an awesome waitress named Shevana S. Her service was excellent and went above and beyond. We need waitresses like her that brings cheers and kindness and concern with our Dining. Because of her we will definitely come back and would like for her to be our waitress. She gets 10 STARS from us. Can’t forget the Manager there who also was awesome and caring. Thank you all .....,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,200 Baychester Ave Suite 208A

48296,86,197,Italian,1,06/30/2022,The absolute worse experience ever. The host sits us at our table. We never received Utensils or napkins. I asked the host for napkins twice. She never brought us our salad. She brought the entrees - pasta - with spoons. Every time I had to remind her for something she would apologize but take her time. Her hair was super long and when she reached over to give my daughter parmesan cheese her hair was over my food. When I asked to speak with a manager he was no where to be found. Then staff miraculously found him. They finally give us Utensils and they are fifty with spots and dried up food on it. At this point I am over it. The manager and his staff need some training. They should have anyone handling the food to have their hair up. Totally disappointed. The manager claimed to have given us a discount but we never saw the receipt so who knows. I will never go back to this olive garden.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,200 Baychester Ave Suite 208A

I think they should give everyone a choice to take the dressing on the side. I really do think the seats need an upgrade. The seating is very unattractive. They should have remodeled after the pandemic.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,200 Baychester Ave Suite 208A

The shades were broken and the sun was just unbearbable to sit there i asked to be moved and the hostos did just that he was very nice. 2. There is no busser to clean the bathrooms they were pretty dirty and smelled bad. A waiter had to stop working to clean the rest room which I find pretty sad for her she is waiting and doing housekeeping pretty unsanitary if u ask me and doing two jobs at once not cool, she was nice but that is not her fault u would think that is managements fault. The Toliets were not functionable let alone lets not talk about the smell . Staff tried there best I saw that, this resturant was really good when they opened it needs guidence and have mature workers as well because they accommodate customers very well comparing to young adults most times not saying they did bad but more guidence helps and more training. In other states Olive garden has the best customer service and the environment is clean. I Think the resturant can get back into the shape to give the resturant better reviews. Although we are in the Bronx it doesnt have to look bad it can be fixed The food was good no complaints but that's is my critic.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,200 Baychester Ave Suite 208A

The server clearly was unhappy with his job when asked how he was doing proceeded to say  ""I'm at work what do you think"", he then brought us adult size glasses for our children . He took our order without writing a single thing down. This would be a great skill if he hadn't fudged up the drink order and brought my husband blue moon instead of stella. He then proceeded to blame the bartender. When my son opened his napkin this is the fork he was given. One of the tines is completely misshapen.

That was delicious and the only reason they got 2 stars from me. The little homemade pita chips were tasty too. But the rest, literally made me sick.  I had salmon which was so small, like 4 bites small and it came with broccoli, broccoli with no butter or salt. If you go don't waste your time with the salmon, and I think it's farm raised and filled with all types of bad stuff they feed farm raised fish. Just skip it!

Not a problem I guess but the restaurant wasn't packed at all and it was only 3 adults and two children, one to which was celebrating his first birthday with a quick meal before going off to other festivities with family. I had to go up front twice for service and we ordered our appetizers and children's entrees together so they wouldn't be agitated and wouldn't care for the appetizers chosen. Our drink came to us sweaty to the rim and obviously had been sitting a while. The soup served was cold so I asked for another bowl to give to the birthday boy while we waited for other food to eat. It's basically like We were sat in the back, had a $194 check, but was  totally forgotten about the ENTIRE time. When the entrees finally came NO ONE ate and we just asked for to go plates. A manager I think named Lea compensated $30 but sheesh honestly at that point since entrees were untouched I would have wanted an better compensation than that but ok. The experience was by far terrible mainly because we were just sat in the VERY BACK ROOM OF THE ESTABLISHMENT where we couldn't really  see anyone else to be honest except to table  outside our room and it felt very uncomfortable  and odd. Reached out to corporate but no response so think I will take it a step further because the treatment was very demeaning and discriminatory.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,200 Baychester Ave Suite 208A

From the start, I was not welcomed in by the host and received a attitude by the host. After I was sat down, I did not get menu and utensils. I had to go get the menu and utensils. After 20 minutes, I have not been served, haven't been greeted by waiter, and not even offered water or beard sticks. Therefore, my family and I left. When we left, the host was not at her station and she was hanging outside the restaurant. Overall,  the restaurant is poorly managed, terrible customer service, no acknowledgement of customer time and money, and no consideration. I will definitely NEVER be coming to this location again.

I ordered the appetizer fried lasagna, calamari and fried ravioli. All of them were good. Also got the Zuppa soup - it was a little salty but still good. My husband ordered pasta with the new spicy sauce and meatballs. He really liked it and said the sauce does have a really good kick to it.    I ordered a bunch of bread sticks.

The Moscato Primo Amore was fabulous and we purchased a bottle to take home and share with friends! The watermelon sangria was good also if not a bit too sweet (who’d think I’d be saying that..lol). The shrimp fritto misto was good..I like how they batter the peppers and shrimp  but I did not really care for the spinach dip..was kind of bland to me! The chips which were maybe sliced pita (?) were a bit too hard and over done with no flavor either. I probably won’t get that again!

We received our straws separately, after asking for them because they didn't come with the drinks.  We waited another 10 minutes for the straws.  We only got the straws because we beckoned a waiter that was passing by...who wasn't our waiter. But we needed straws! Everything was a repeated request and a wait.  We were there a lot longer than we had to be .  I thought the waitress was too talkative!  Every time she came to the table, she gave us a play by play of what she was doing or was going to do. It was like watching football game and hearing the play by play! In a football game, that information is useful.  In a restaurant, it's annoying! .",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,200 Baychester Ave Suite 208A
48344,136,197,Italian,4,05/26/2022,Our waiter seemed pretty high she literally had seen my family and myself just be seated came over introduced herself said she was gonna give us a few minutes to settle in which was fine came back between 3 and 5 minutes asking us about appetizers water and drinks and long story short she wasn't on top of bringing the UNLIMITED BREADSTICKS & SALAD so we only had 1 order of each and she wasn't very attentive and when she talked to us she talked to us like we are ghetto people and as if we are friends umm sorry sweetheart we are not friends that's a place of business you need to learn how to talk to the customers. Oh and last thing she tried to make me feel very stupid as if I don't know how to use the kiosk machine which I definitely know how to use it. That location has become very ghetto very unprofessional and just yuck.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,200 Baychester Ave Suite 208A
48345,137,197,Italian,4,05/26/2022,Good service. Enjoyed my strawberry-passion fruit lemonade. Friend did not like the Long Island Iced Tea.  The spaghetti and meat sauce was satisfying. The meatballs were a little salty.  Friend stated that they were satisfied with the chicken parmesan.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,200 Baychester Ave Suite 208A
48346,139,197,Italian,4,05/26/2022,Food was good! Server seemed new and was unfamiliar with some things that we always get from the menu like the unlimited soup and salad.    Food did take a while to come.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,200 Baychester Ave Suite 208A

48348,141,197,Italian,2,05/26/2022,"Our server was nice but the service was slow. We asked for breadsticks and never received the second basket and the first was burned. But- yknow, it's olive garden so our expectations were already low",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,200 Baychester Ave Suite 208A
48349,142,197,Italian,1,05/26/2020,"Horrible. Don’t ever cater your food from Olive Garden! We catered from Olive Garden a few years ago and had a great experience but this year it was terrible. Will never do it again. This year we ordered over $200 So many things went wrong:    1) They told me over the phone when I placed the order that the food would be ready between 3 and 5pm.  2) I sent my daughter and nephew to pick up the food at 4:00. The food was NOT ready. They kept telling my nephew 10 more minutes....so my nephew and daughter waited.  3) An HOUR AND A HALF later they were still waiting. Instead of telling them the food was not made and would take two more hours, they made them wait there. Our family was sitting around waiting for the food and missing these kids. At the very least, they could have told them it was not ready and to come back in a couple of hours. Instead they kept them there waiting. Family had flown in to spend XMAS eve together and these kids were waiting there for TWO hours!  4) I tried calling multiple times to find out what was going on. They put me on hold for over 10 minutes on one call, over 20 minutes on another.  5) The manager (Matthew) instead accepting responsibility, LIED and said he had informed my nephew that there would be a two hour wait and he CHOSE to wait. That was not true. My nephew and daughter kept being told the food was coming just 10 minutes more""  6) When the food arrived, the salads were wilted and gray. There were no serving utensils, paper napkins or paper plates..all of which were supposed to be included.  7) Instead of ice tea, they sent lemonade.    VERY BAD. DO NOT CATER YOUR FOOD FROM OLIVE GARDEN. If there was a lower rating, I would use it. I forgot to add that my order was over $200 and they were still going to charge a delivery fee!",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,200 Baychester Ave Suite 208A
48350,143,197,Italian,4,05/26/2021,So this was my first time eating Olive Garden so I can't compare it to any other location . I had Shrimp Scampi and it was delicious . I love the salad it was a perfect amount of flavor and not to overdressed . However my family member which is a frequent at Olive Garden said the bread sticks were a little cold and dry . That is the only reason I gave them 4 stars and not 5 . The service and my waitress was great fast friendly and we got our food in a timely manner.  I would certainly visit again and would recommend this location for a good family dinner.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,200 Baychester Ave Suite 208A

48353,146,197,Italian,1,05/26/2021,The staff that worked today ruined my mother's day for my family and I.  I had an order catered for a 3pm pick up curbside. Long story short I ended up going inside to pick up my food and stood at the door for 2hrs waiting for an order that was placed more then 24hrs in advance. Then we get food home and I was missing the utensils that I order and paid for extra breadsticks and received none.  I spent $168.00 to get only half my food and some of my guests leave before brunch arrived to my home.  Not to mention that during the whole ordeal I asked to speak to a manager and he or she couldnt even give me the common courtesy to come and speak with me.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,200 Baychester Ave Suite 208A
48354,147,197,Italian,3,05/27/2019,My family and I had dinner here on the Saturday of Mother’s Day weekend . We waited a little under 30 mins before we were seated which wasn’t too bad considering the holiday. I guess we arrived during a shift change or something because nobody ever came to our table . I had to call on another waiter to ask for one . After about 15 minutes our waiter came and apologized. Everything after the wait was pleasant . The food was great and came out pretty quick. Our waiter was sweet and attentive . He definitely made up for the wait. I recommend this place on a not so busy day.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,200 Baychester Ave Suite 208A

48358,151,197,Italian,4,05/27/2019,"Food was good, waiter was good. It was a friends birthday and they allowed us to bring our own cake, which they put their own candles on and brought out and sang.  My only issue was the hostess would not allow my friend to bring her stroller to the table, even though we pointed out twice that there was tons of room. We then saw a neighboring table with a stroller. We had to bring this to the managers attention because we felt discriminated against (neighboring table and hostess were the same race and different than us).

My seafood stuffed mushroom appetizer was very tasty and filling. My wife's shrimp scampi appetizer was also filling and delicious.

The restaurant had many tables empty but not enough staff so there was a 20 minute wait to be seated.   The waitress Keisha was excellent!  She was managing multiple tables and one with a large party like a pro.  She really made the difference to our dining experience.   Bathrooms were not clean.

The salad tasted like bagged pre made salad. I hadn't been there in awhile and was looking forward to the food. It was just ok. I had the angel hair pasta with shrimp scampi.  Our server was FANTASTIC which made the lunch experience nice.

48366,159,197,Italian,1,05/26/2021,"After my sisters and I had a beautiful Monday (3/21/2021)afternoon we decided to have lunch at this sad excuse for an establishment. The service was extremely horrible from the moment we arrived until we left. Upon arrival we’re told to provide our contact info due to a 35min wait time and that we’d be notified when our table was ready. After 35 mins we return then are asked to wait an additional 15mins because our table is being cleaned so we wait. After 25 mins 6 other parties were let in before us, four of those families arrived after us and one of them was a family of TEN! We asked to see a manager because the waiting was absorbed at this point! Not only were we annoyed at the extra wait time but to be told our table was being cleaned then let 6 other parties in ahead of us??? I’ve never worked in the restaurant industry but I’m sure it doesn’t take 25MINS to clean a table. Once we’re inside I noticed how damp and empty it was. Trying to figure what went wrong....come to find out in the end, the hostess never entered our information     I had a roasted chicken and Gnoochi soup. I would’ve enjoyed had I not been in the bathroom up chucking it into the porcelain God Porcelaneous!    It’s safe to say we won’t ever be going back to the OLIVE GARDEN IN BAY PLAZA!",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,200 Baychester Ave Suite 208A

He attended to us thoroughly the entire night. Our drinks were always full, he checked w/us several times to ask how we were enjoying the food. The salad and breadsticks were extremely fresh! I ordered the four cheese stuffed shells and my husband ordered the asiago tortelloni w/grilled chicken. Both entrees were so delicious! We also asked for a take home dinner, and when I asked if there was chicken I could add on to that meal for our daughter at home, he rushed to check and make sure we had it as the kitchen was closing up. The desserts we ordered were scrumptious as well. All in all, a fantastic experience!",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,200 Baychester Ave Suite 208A

48376,169,197,Italian,1,05/26/2020,Went this evening with my child and it was absolutely horrible. The lady in the front had a terrible attitude. I was standing in front of her face she told me to sit and I refused as I am pregnant and didn’t feel comfortable sitting so I stood. A group of people came in who did not have reservations or anything and she gladly takes them and ignores me while a customer makes her aware that I was in front of the group and she ignores the customer and my self. I was extremely upset spoke with the manager who sat me and my child. My server was nice and polite but I believe he had to many tables as my food came very late and very very dry.

They also didn't have any bread sticks and I had to wait 30 min to get a refill if my soup n bread sticks. The server was good, but overwhelmed and wasn't able to cater to all her tables in a timely manner. We arrived around 12 noon to get the lunch special, unlimited soup salad n bread sticks.

48379,173,197,Italian,1,05/26/2020,The worst service I ever had in a restaurant we were told the wait would be 35 minutes that turned into an hour. It took an another employee to notice that we and other customers were waiting too long for no reason there were tables available. The waitress took our order gave us the salad first. I noticed we had no bread and ask the waitress she said it was in the oven.The waitress  came to us about half an hour later to ask if we were ok we told her we had no drinks. There were other customers having same issues. The silverware  ware were dirty had to ask for hot water to clean our silverware  and the tables were all dirty it took them 45 minutes to clean tables. Employees did not care were all talking not caring.This is the coop city location in the Bronx. Our service was so horrible we got here at 7pm and at 9:07pm we still had no food. This location needs a whole new management and employee. If I had an option to give them a zero I would. Disgusted with the service.

Manager In pink shirt working as waiter instead of supervisor..  it was a better male waiter who should have been the supervisor but no..  I don’t usually like Olive Garden but is perfect for family.. food not good or consistent.. but today the worst day. Our table had so much bad issues. So today it was us at the table of bad serving. At the end we ordered a dish for a family member to take home and they forgot the shrimp. The bad young first waiter we had. He was mocking us and laughing. As a restaurant manager. I will have not tolerated the behavior from a server to anyone..  So Olive Garden perhaps you should do some re-training or ask Magianos restaurant to help re-training your staff.

49038,4,202,Italian,4,04/26/2023,"Very nice little Italian restaurant with tasty,  elevated food, good cocktails, and solid service.    Highly recommend the smoked rosemary negroni for a cocktail.   It’s very unique, not too sweet, and just very nice drink.    I had the baked clams to start.   A half dozen dressed nicely and buttery yummy.    For a main course, I went with pasta and did the gnocchi with short rib ragu.  I loved gnocchi’s texture and savory flavor.  The short rib was tender and tasty, though the flavor of the ragu wasn’t quite to my taste (it was nicely done, just a bit sweeter than I prefer).    All-in-all, this is a great place for some solid Italian.",Maria Restaurant,11 Huguenot St

49047,13,202,Italian,3,04/26/2023,"My expectations for this place were pretty high based on reviews but was a let down. Everything was only okay. Several appetizers were ordered to get a feel for the flavors and the two we enjoyed most were the Burrata & Beets and Salmon Tartare. Overall food was quite bland. Servers were attentive but they were more preoccupied keeping tables open rather than improving the experience of existing diners. We had many dishes, so instead of adding an additional table as one waiter suggested, they took away our bread (which we were going to eat with our apps), bottle of water, and uncomfortably crammed  as much as he could. Pricing is justified when all the elements of the dining experience are present- certainly not the case here.  Atmosphere and service are alright, food is okay, and we had dinner on what felt like plastic plates. Not interested in returning.",Maria Restaurant,11 Huguenot St
49048,14,202,Italian,5,05/26/2021,"I always love eating here. Food and staff are always amazing.  We tried the burrata and the eggplant fries as appetizers and was delicious, the fries with the right amount of saltiness and the burrata to make that contrast since is creamy and a little sweet. Amazing.  As main course we had the oxtail gnocchi which is their signature dish, is so good that the 3 times i have been here i have order this dish. Also, we had Garganelli white veal bolognese which was the first time for me trying the dish and it was very flavorful but light as well. I really recommend it. (Forgot to take a picture).  Lastly we appreciate a lot the way the restaurant is operating now with the pandemic since it looks they are doing a very good job at keeping everything clean, sanitized and covered for all the guest. All the plates and silverware are wrapped before use and staff is wearing their appropriate PPE and are keeping their distance as much as posible. Great job guys.    Overall if you’re looking for a place to eat really delicious food in a nice environment this is the place to go.",Maria Restaurant,11 Huguenot St

49051,18,202,Italian,3,03/27/2023,"Food was delicious but the service was terrible. Aside from general lack of attentiveness and checking if our food was any good, they had a number of issues.    One drink we ordered initially was forgotten until we reminded them.    We asked for a soda and glass of wine mid meal, then had to remind the server of this order. They brought the soda but instead of wine they brought a glass of sparking water in a wine glass. The sparkling water was another servers drink! They brought a bottle of flat water to make up for it, which was kind of ridiculous...    We went around 3 pm and I think they were between shifts/down staff, and the food was delicious, so I'm giving 3 stars but I hope they train their FOH staff better because they could've handled the mistakes much better.",Maria Restaurant,11 Huguenot St
49052,19,202,Italian,3,04/26/2023,Chicken Parm/pasta. The pasta was overcooked and the chicken was over fried. Some pieces were like leather.  Real deal calms we’re tasty.  Lamb chops needed seasoning-salt but none on the table.  The expression gelato saved the day!,Maria Restaurant,11 Huguenot St
49053,20,202,Italian,5,04/26/2023,When we walked into the restaurant we were greeted by an extremely rude hostess which set a bad tone for us.

The week before we tried a new restaurant for us on Christmas Eve. The Christmas Eve restaurant seemed over taxed with a full house and takeout orders. It took over 2 1/2 hours to eat with no dessert ( they never asked us).  Maria on the did the smart thing, no overbooking and handled the crowd ( and the restaurant was full) with ease and grace.  Everything was delicious, the fried zucchini to the Chicken Scarpariello to the Pounded Pork Chop Parm to the Offogato was all top flight and served in a relaxed, timely fashion.  Giovanni, the owner came to our table to check how everything was more than once and received glowing reports each stop.  Talking about stops... we'll stop by again.",Maria Restaurant,11 Huguenot St

49060,28,202,Italian,5,05/26/2020,"First visit over a year ago... Maria’s has been a staple in our life since. Of more recent appreciation, the Rigatoni Sunday Sauce dish. Ordered on 11/22/2019, just like Grandma’s... Meatballs-Sausage-Pasta in that order. Michelin status has not swayed the consistency. Maria’s is at its Best! Love you guys & gals! …",Maria Restaurant,11 Huguenot St

The mushroom ravioli was so flavorful and was just enough to be full without being stuffed. Definitely worth treating yourself with a meal at Maria's!",Maria Restaurant,11 Huguenot St

On top of that, my husband and I sat at the bar where we hung out with Eric, the bartender, who was awesome. Between the service, the food, the drinks, the conversation... We felt like we were in Nonna's kitchen. We will definitely be back. Can't wait until the next visit!",Maria Restaurant,11 Huguenot St
49065,34,202,Italian,4,05/26/2021,"I don't have a complaint, but I do have a suggestion. Maria is on the cusp of what could be excellent dining without any pretense. The bar is well-stocked and the bartender knowledgeable, and both trendy and local spirits are offered. The food borders on high end Italian, but I noticed some quality lacking. The menu lists Parmesan as an ingredient in their famous oxtail ragu gnocchi, and given the Michelin mention, I figured it would be freshly grated ""real"" paremesan. However, it looked like the kind that you put on a slice of 99 cent pizza and had no flavor. Also, the dish was too hot. Temperature seems to be a bit of an issue, suffering between two extremes. I would revisit temperature and also upgrade the ingredients. Also, and this could be applied to food (why not feature Hudson Valley farms more?), the take out containers look cheap and are not sustainable. Why is a trying-to-be a high end business not on the cutting edge of sustainability? I know COVID has been tough, but the plastics used cannot be recycled. It's definitely time to upgrade to paper and compostable materials, if not something even more inventive. All of that said, I want to end on a high note. The restaurant had extremely friendly and welcoming staff. The chef and bartender were very generous, and are genuinely interested in getting to know their clientele. This has already created customer loyalty, so I think continuing to improve where there are growth opportunities can only improve Maria's future.",Maria Restaurant,11 Huguenot St
49066,35,202,Italian,5,05/26/2021,Fantastic Place! The service as well as the food is excellent. I highly recommend the gnocchi with oxtail. This is a picture of what I had. Outdoor seating is nice with shade provided. Will return again!,Maria Restaurant,11 Huguenot St
49067,36,202,Italian,2,08/29/2022,"Firstly this restaurant came highly recommended. The lunch meals are GROSSLY overpriced! The eggplant Parmigiano was $24. THE PORTION SIZE was more like a $12 portion. The BBQ Veal was $26 and it wasn't any GOOD. The portion was small and the veal tough! It was over a bed of rice that was soaking in vinegar, tomato and cucumber. Not a good  combination at all. We had to ask 2x for bread to be put on the table and the dipping olive oil was acrid. Sorry, but definitely not going back.",Maria Restaurant,11 Huguenot St

49070,39,202,Italian,4,01/26/2023,I have to be honest for the prices? I think it's a little expensive. A three time bib gourmand recognized restaurant. They're obviously doing something right,Maria Restaurant,11 Huguenot St
49071,40,202,Italian,5,12/27/2022,Misticanza salad with grilled chicken was probably the best one I ever had. We’ll done!  Definitely coming back again.,Maria Restaurant,11 Huguenot St

49076,45,202,Italian,4,05/26/2022,Really good food in an out of the way place.  Came with group of four people - various pastas were excellent.  The calamari is SPICY!!  Menu changes regularly - be aware that a number of items on their online menu are not regularly available in the restaurant.  Reasonably good wine list.  Food is 5 star - service can be a bit shaky and disjointed - we had a couple dishes brought to our table that were not for us.  Would go back.,Maria Restaurant,11 Huguenot St

49078,47,202,Italian,1,05/26/2022,"The food is terribly mediocre. When we arrived the server popped down an iPad and started scrolling thru pictures of appetizers. Weird. We ordered bang bang Brussels sprouts, which were swimming in honey syrup. We had pasta spring vegetables and veal bolognese- both of which arrived in starchy clumps. We escaped before dessert. I have no idea where these 5 star reviews came from.",Maria Restaurant,11 Huguenot St
49079,48,202,Italian,2,07/30/2022,"It's a shame that the food is so good but the service is terrible. It shouldn't take almost 1 hour and 40 minutes on a half empty restaurant for a small group of people to get their food. On top of this the waitress ran outside to remind us to tip her, yet we left get an 18% tip. So unprofessional to run after a client that spent over 900 dollars with 18% tip to ask for a bigger tip. SO RIDICULOUS THE SERVICE IS TERRIBLE WILL NEVER GO BACK!!",Maria Restaurant,11 Huguenot St
49080,49,202,Italian,1,05/26/2022,"That little hidden gem is lost forever  The restaurant we enjoyed so much it changed  drastically from a few months ago to what it is today, the personnel poorly trained (the fingers inside the serving bowls are killers, throwing the plates to your way not-so good, the sticky wine glasses not a pleasant feeling ) they are not the best impression for a memorable night, and finally the food was cold and not what we used to enjoy …when the waitress offer to send the owner (he never showed up) she just sent another waitress to apologize.  Very sad last time at this place,  it used to be vibrant and the food to knock your socks off…maybe Michelin needs to go back and reconsider that star.",Maria Restaurant,11 Huguenot St

49088,57,202,Italian,5,05/26/2022,"Went for Hudson Valley Restaurant Week and so glad we came. Glazed Pork Ribs, Burrata and Beets, and Salmon Tartare appetizers were amazing. Bang Bang Brussels were a little too charred and we didn't finish it. Gnocchi Oxtail Ragu was ""bussin"", and Tortiglioni al Forno, Cut Fettuccine w/ Lamb Ragu,  Lamb Chops, and vanilla sundays were very tasty. Huguenot cocktail was delicious.",Maria Restaurant,11 Huguenot St
49089,58,202,Italian,3,05/26/2022,"Some good and some bad with this place. On the positive side the staff were all accommodating and attentive, as well as friendly. The pistachio gelato was phenomenal as well as the artichoke appetizer. A couple of things that brought the experience down were noise and my main course. The space is tight; you may get to know uncomfortable personal details about the stranger sitting near you as the decibel levels are loud. Shouting to be heard above the din felt like the de-facto form of communication. Filet mignon, medium, as my main dish felt like the right choice even with the $39 dollar price tag. However what I received would barely have passed as medium rare. Felt undercooked, stringy, and had a large proportion of fat. For the amount it cost would I say worth it? Hard no. On the flip side my companion had gnocchi which I tasted and we both agreed was excellent.    All in all Maria is a good restaurant but just not quite at the level to make it truly outstanding. Cheers.",Maria Restaurant,11 Huguenot St

The roasted brussel sprouts as an appetizer are to die for  Their BBQ Veal Steak is amazinggggggggggg. I’m drooling thinking about it. Their menu does change seasonally but it’s a guarantee that you will have a hard time deciding what to eat because everything is going to sound delicious.

I wasn't familiar with New Rochelle so I took to online reviews, & was able to narrow my list of suitable pre-wedding family dinner places for a large 20 something group.  Maria Restaurant was one of the places on my ""short list"", which readily became my ""list of one"".  In addition to lots of terrific online reviews, Maria's chef/owner, Giovanni, was very accessible by email, answered questions promptly, and made things very easy for an out of towner to understand what his restaurant had to offer.    Dinner was absolutely fantastic.  In all respects. I used the menu for large groups, and the food was so delicious.  The menu was varied, imaginative, and every dish was super tasty.  The service was impeccable.  Even when the restaurant got crowded, we always had top notch service by the friendly, knowledgeable, always present wait staff. The atmosphere at the restaurant was also terrific... a lively, beautiful space but completely suitable for intimate conversations between family members who hadn't seen each other for a long time.

I went on a Wednesday at 7pm and it took over 30 minutes to place an order. Only one waiter, bartender was trying to help as well and another woman who didn’t seem to understand when we asked for water or the check. Waiter was apologizing to ga or after table who complained about the delays in service.  For appetizer we had the eggplant fries which arrived cold and tuna tartare appetizer which was decent except for the oxidized avocado in it and the weird flatbread crackers it was served with. For the main we ordered the cavatelli which was fine and garganelli which lacked the truffle flavor profile. It was mostly just salt.

The Yulupa Pinot Noir is amazing! Very fresh seafood. My other favorite restaurant in New Rochelle is Dubrovnik, but they offer a different cuisine. Happy to see that Maria Restaurant has broccoli rabe on the menu. Hoping to see Italian ricotta cheesecake added to the menu some day. I have yet to find an Italian restaurant in the area that offers ricotta cheesecake  (Update, Apr 29: went back again, super happy that the restaurant made up for the kitchen error the other day)  Tried a new dish - salmon/trout.

It was bland and had chunks of ground beef in it. Don't remember it being that way previously.  Minestrone would have been better choice. My son ordered fettuccine Alfredo. He chose the gnocchi soup. Very little gnocchi and chicken in the soup so disappointed.  I ordered  a unsweetened iced tea, no lemon was given. Overall, a 5 out of 10. No compelling reason to return again.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,762 US-202

49485,1,205,Italian,5,10/28/2022,The service was very good. The waitress was very friendly and efficient.  However the food was very bland. However the pasta was cooked well but there wasn't enough sauce and didn't have much flavor.  I didn't like that we were seated right next to the entrance either.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,9025 Xavier Dr
49486,2,205,Italian,3,08/29/2022,I would of given the Restaurant another star had it not been for the smell of musky carpet around the area me & family were seated & the dusty blinds on the window. Besides this the waiter was really nice & on point with our orders & beverages. The food was really good & my kids in joyed theirs meals as well. The price of the meals are really fair. If your around the area I still recommend you come & bring your family.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,9025 Xavier Dr
49487,3,205,Italian,1,05/26/2022,I really can’t stand this place. For some God forsaken reason the kids love it. The service is so bad here. The portions of food get smaller every year. The kids menu used to order ice cream or some form of treat included with the meal but not anymore. You spend more and more but continue to get less and less it’s mind blowing how the franchise is still around.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,9025 Xavier Dr

The servers were friendly.(our server Denise 1/27/2023) did a superb job.  The food was delicious.    Will have to go back one day and try other things on the menu.  Had the chicken Alfredo.

But from time to time, we sit down, the waitress Ms. Richelle D is very professional , courteous and polite, and a great person. Can get enough of the wine selection we always get sevinion Blanc the house wine, good taste my favorite dish.

Besides that I have no complaints about the place. The food was good, & the service was very nice too . I went to a mother's day brunch & even though the place was kind of crowded; the wait for a table was only like 20 maybe 30 minutes, & the place has a cool low key vibe to it.

49508,24,205,Italian,2,02/25/2023,"The serving staff was excellent, the front of house staff was terrible, disorganized, and the 45 minute wait they said would be 25 minutes was due to them ""missing us"" on the list and seating 4 other same size parties ahead of us.

Glad I did because the two slices of eggplant was very crisp and tasty, but the spaghetti was cold. They should saute the spaghetti in a little olive oil with garlic and oregano to give it flavor, and, if done just before serving, it would help to retain heat.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,9025 Xavier Dr

49515,31,205,Italian,1,05/26/2021,"I visit this location very often and have never seen anything like this, ever! I called in and had my issue completely ignored! Very unprofessional! I know you guys are extremely busy during the holidays, but letting this get by you is unbelievable! The little guy sat on top as if it was garnish of some sort.

49518,35,205,Italian,2,05/26/2020,"This is my normal Olive Garden, I normally have a great experence here but today was completely different. I sat down waited almost 20 minutes for my waiter, the manager was walking by I asked him for my drinks. My food came out before my appetizer so I asked to cancel it. Food was okay but service was horrible today I'm surprised.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,9025 Xavier Dr
49519,36,205,Italian,3,05/27/2018,"We walked in post 1 pm and they were pretty full but did manage to accommodate us without a big wait . What we ate tasted good -the problem being that there wasn’t much to choose from - being a vegetarian, the menu has / had very limited options.  They were out of mozzarella sticks ( the only other vegetarian option) and so we ordered the zucchini bites as appetisers which tasted good.  We ordered a dinner portion of capavoti pasta in pesto sauce and asked them to make it spicy- and spicy is what they made it- so spicy that our sinuses were cleared. The pasta came with salad which was fresh but had too much dressing for our taste and hence we didn’t have much of it ! Moscow mules on the side and an ice cream sundae to end the lunch and our meal was done.  Service was friendly.  I would definitely go back if they had more vegetarian appetiser/ mains  options ! The three stars is just for lack of options for vegetarians.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,9025 Xavier Dr

49533,52,205,Italian,5,02/25/2023,I love this place! And the endless bowl of salad and breadsticks lol  I’m vegetarian so the options at restaurants are usually limited for me but here they’re more than willing to accommodate and switch/eliminate non-vegetarian stuff from the dishes. I love the mint chocolate too.  It’s my go-to Italian place when I want to get good food on a budget hehe,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,9025 Xavier Dr

49553,73,205,Italian,4,11/27/2022,"Pretty good.  The value is great.  A couple of new menu options are tasty (gnocci chicken soup tastes a bit like chicken pot pie, Hale & Hearty-ish; marsala fettucine also surprisingly well made).  Our waiter was incredibly patient and very attentive.    Of course, the bread sticks and salad are sort of a trademarked item and are alone worth a visit.    Dining room was large and spread out, with bar area, fireplace, and ample waiting room (Sunday seemed to be a busy day).",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,9025 Xavier Dr
49554,74,205,Italian,2,05/27/2019,"As much as I like Olive Garden and it's flavors, the last couple of times that I've been to this particular location in Yonkers it's been less than mediocre... Not only the flavor was not as other locations (lacked a lot of salt and taste for that matter), but also the option was ridiculous... For $18.99 this is not what I expect.... And certainly not what I have experienced at any other Olive Gardens... Not to mention this location is more $$ than others (except times square obviously)...  Way less than I expect from an Olive garden... I didn't touch the plate before this picture this is the exact amount of food I received... For almost $20dlls????? ... I'd happily pay it if it was worth it but it was so not",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,9025 Xavier Dr

Wine tasting is an option should you want a glass of wine.  The taste I was given was a bit tart which means the bottle had to have been open for some time.  I explained that to our server and she was kind enough to open a new bottle. Needless to say I had 2 glasses of the red wine I tasted.

49581,102,205,Italian,3,02/25/2023,I like Olive Garden but here's my critique.  All of the young ladies and gentlemen handling food should wear a hair net.  There is to much free flowing hair floating around. The people who are catering to the take out need hair nets. It should be mandatory.  Can't give it a 5 until that happens.    2023 and still no hair nets. If you are preparing and bagging food hair nets should be mandatory.  What's it going to take for the owner to understand this? I guess management us waiting for the inevitable.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,9025 Xavier Dr

49587,108,205,Italian,2,06/30/2022,Not good. Used to love Olive Garden. Used to go with family plenty of times in past but in the last 5 years or so it's been steadily going downhill.    Salad used to be crispy and good but now it's been soggier. Fried calamari used to be crunchy and good but now it's just a but mushy/soggy.    I like chicken parm however it's overcooked and super salty. Though it does still taste pretty good. Breadsticks not great either. Table seemed kind of sticky. Maybe it's the location or maybe new management at this location I ate at with family. Would have to try the other one we used to go to to compare but yeah...kind of going to stop going here for a while or maybe forever dunno... But not impressed. Used to be great.,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,9025 Xavier Dr

Went in for a table and a girl working in the front at 6pm, not sure her name, had a snippy attitude and does not smile. Had a table in the front and a few waiters and waitresses went by us. Not one went to our table. Waited a few minutes and just walked out. It was like we were not even there. This happened today on June 21st",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,9025 Xavier Dr
49592,113,205,Italian,1,05/27/2018,I came in today to this Olive Garden with my best friend and his wife. We were waiting to be seated. Then another couple with their kids came in a party of 5 and we were a party of three. Then all of the sudden three big booty women come in and they get seated before we were seated and the couple behind us was seated. This was plain disrespectful and upsetting after you drive all the way from Manhattan to have a friendly get together to see that this African American server after seen some big booty latinas can't control himself and seats them down and gives them all the priority in the world.

No one came to our table, zero. A few waiters and waitresses walked by and absolutely nothing, no ""hello"",  no ""I will be right with you"". It was like we were invisible. We just got up and left. The worst olive garden on the planet!!!",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,9025 Xavier Dr
49597,118,205,Italian,5,08/29/2022,"I've been here twice within the past couple months. My first meal was from the lunch special which included unlimited breadsticks and salad plus soup.  I have the zuppa Toscana soup. It was delish! The Bellini Peach iced tea was made with just the right amount of syrup Good service, affordable price,( all you can eat for $9.99 from 11am - 2:30pm,M-F) and great food.. I was a happy camper that day!    Noa let me share with you about my dining experience during my second visit,which was last week. Unfortunately it was not a pleasant one. To be fair, the waitress was great! I believe her name is Falina. I ordered the chicken marsala with fettuccine alfredo. I'm sorry to say that I was disappointed. To me the chicken tasted a bit too tough. We ordered breadsticks and salad with our meal to share. The salad had too many big  chunks of lettuce and not enough hot peppers tomato olive and onion. I ordered the mango strawberry iced tea which was very weakly brewed and hardly any syrup in it. I informed the restaurant about these things. The best part of our meal was the breadsticks. Oh I forgot to mention that I reordered the zuppa Toscana for which it's taste met my expectations a second time around.    In summary, I suppose that with any restaurant you dine in,you  may have a meal that's a hit or a miss. I'll still come back to the Olive Garden... just to have breadsticks, salad and Zuppa Toscana soup. My friend suggested that I order the herb crusted salmon next time. I had a sample of hers and found it to be  really tasty. So I'll include it on my list as one of my go-to meals as well. But be prepared... they'll give you a huge side of steamed broccoli and if you're not a broccoli fan perhaps you could ask for a substitute vegetable or side.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,9025 Xavier Dr

49606,127,205,Italian,2,07/30/2022,"After my Mom's burial at nearby Woodlawn Cemetery yesterday, I called the Olive Garden to see if they could accommodate our group of 11 for lunch.  The woman who answered my call informed me that there was no waiting and that they could immediately seat us all upon arrival.  We arrived there within 15 minutes and the place was almost empty.  As I checked in with the front Hostess I advised her that our group had arrived.  She immediately told me that there was a 1 hour wait.  When I tried to inform her that I had just called, she rudely stated ""Sir, I am the Hostess and the only person who answers the phone.""  When I tried to tell her about my previous phone conversation, she then stated ""that person had no right to answer the phone and it'll be a 1 hour wait.""   No apology, a total lack of customer service, and a totally condescending attitude.  So we all left, went next door to Longhorns and spent over $250 for our lunch.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,9025 Xavier Dr
49607,128,205,Italian,3,06/30/2022,"I wasn't too impressed. The place wasn't crowded so we were seated promptly considering there was 1 hostess and she had walk each party to their tables. So far so good.    The waitress was very nice and professional and took our orders quickly. Another plus.    Then came my soup, zuppa toscana, the flavor was good, as expected, but somehow I had the feeling that it wasn't fresh. It didn't look freshly made.    Then we had to wait for the main entrees. In my opinion those took too long, probably 20 minutes. I had the shrimp and chicken carbonara and it was just ok. It had too much sauce and, wait for it, it didn't look fresh so I wondered why it took so long to be brought to our table.    My wife had sirloin with pasta. I tasted a piece of the sirloin and I didn't like it and it definitely didn't taste fresh.    My advise: go to a different OG.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,9025 Xavier Dr
49608,129,205,Italian,3,06/30/2022,"This review is a 3.5 and here is why...  Let's just say, we enjoy the food at Olive Garden. Unfotunately, during this visit the service was quite slow. We arrived at 6:45 pm on a Saturday and were seated after waiting 30 mininutes.  We received our non-alcoholic drinks 20 minutes after that. It took an additional 30 minutes before we received our salad and breadsticks. We ordered our meals right away since we had plenty of time to look at the menu. The 50 minute wait became  tricky with a five year old and an elderly parent, even with computer games and great conversation. Sadly, my daughter consumed her apple juice as the salad and breadsticks arrived for the adults.  She is allergic to both egg and dairy products which we informed the waiter about prior to ordering. It took another 15 minutes to bring out her plain breadsticks after we initially received our salads. While we patiently sat waiting for my daughter to have anything to eat, we questioned our waiter about the lack of priority for a child to be without food while the adults at the table had been served. He really didn't have a justified answer,  but responded, ""I got you.""  When 10 more minutes passed without the breadsticks,  we asked to speak with a manager. The manager came to our table shortly after our entrees arrived at the 50 minute mark. Jasmine listened to our concerns, then said she would amend our check for the inconvenience. We left a more than fair tip for the waiter, even though our delay was lengthy. He was courteous though inexperienced, and made up on the back end for the failures on the front end. Not sure what the overall issue was... the kitchen staff or the lack of experience from our server. We did however notice two families who came in after us, received their meals before us. We were never informed why the service took so long. Once the meals came, we did thoroughly enjoy them. My suggestion would be to go to this restaurant earlier in the evening to avoid a lengthy wait at dinner time.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,9025 Xavier Dr
49609,130,205,Italian,2,05/26/2022,"I love Olive Garden but I think I need to take a break from them, I really didn't like our waiter. Myself and 2 others went there around 2pm, we were told there was no  soup because it was being prepared, but the table across from us had some, the waiter kept coming over to us every 10 minutes and it felt like we were being rushed not only by him but also by the young man who cleans the tables off who kept coming around and as he left us he'd shake his head, mind you the restaurant was not crowded nor did they have a people waiting to be seated. I don't think I've ever felt like I did on this visit.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,9025 Xavier Dr

I decide to go inside and was told there was a change in shifts and no one bothered to give me my food. The person who gave me my food apologized for the fact of the change in shifts and that my food had not been delivered.

I didn't recieve not a dollar off, and I'm not the type to beg for a discount for your poor sanitary conditions. Bad experience = not coming back, BEWARE EVERYONE THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE JUST THE $$  Also I was recommended by staff not to order soup because of a new trainee who was just learning.

50129,5,209,Italian,5,06/30/2022,"came here after dinner with my aunt who flew into town… We we’re around the area & I had previously been here before during their soft opening, I don’t think the indoor sections / restaurant open… To my surprise; the back outdoor section was available and the inside was finished.. immediately upon entry , my guests were taken back by how beautiful and elegant the location had finally finished to be… we came for drinks so we were sat in a beautiful middle section between the bar and outdoor section ( best of both worlds ) . Just with the scenery and aesthetic my company was taken back , then to add to the spectacular location & establishment…. Our server Alex , just raised the bar and set the tone. She was super sweet and attentive.. she was very pleasant and caring, recommendation were superb! Alex was our host, and truly delivered a fine dining experienced. She elevated the experience with her generous and hospitable aura. She was very pleasant and will definitely ask for her next time! Loved the way she serviced her tables not only mine.. vvery attentive and on top of it all! Very well spent evening with family out of town , for a beautiful rich experience from atmosphere to cuisine to staff. Thank you for having us!",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50130,6,209,Italian,4,11/27/2022,I went here for brunch a couple of weeks ago. It is a nice little spot. Its a little more than your average pancakes. It is also a cool date night place. The parking lot is tiny so you will be subjected to street parking. We came on an early Sunday afternoon so parking was easy.    Service was A-1. We ordered primarily from the brunch menu but I would return for the oysters and the spicy paloma alone. The eggs benedict with smoke salmon was pretty good but I didn't like the cerviche. I will definitely return soon.,Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50131,7,209,Italian,5,06/30/2022,"Wonderful! Excellent! Superb service! Dinner was phenomenal! Members of our party ordered Cesar Salad,  Arugala Pear Salad, Portobello Salad, Calamari Fritti, Grilled Lemon Chicken, Surf and Turf with rosemary mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables,  Mediterranean Lamp Chops, Latte, Capuchino, Almond Layered  Cake, Tiramisu, New York Style Cheesecake and Chocolate Caramel Crunch cake. EVERYTHING was exquisitely delicious! Our bill reflected the genuine quality of the food and service we enjoyed.  The ambiance was perfect! WELL COME AGAIN.

Everything was cooked to perfection, the octapus, scallops, ribeye, and branzino. They used quality ingredients, with well thought out flavors. The portions were bigger than expected. The service was good, and I loved the ambience. I will definitely be going back soon.",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50133,9,209,Italian,3,05/26/2022,The indoor dinning area is very nice and looms amazing on the other hand the patio looks run down contruction equipment were left out in the open just not very esthetic at all.    The food was good we had the lamb will recommend they very tasty order side of grill veggies taste was good but they arrived cold. One of the plates in out party came out 20 min later after everyone else they must have forgotten to put in the order.    Staff is friendly but very slow took about 15 min to get a drink and coffee. We also order ice cream they did not have the flavor we asl sever brought another of his choice with out consulting because the one we order was out of stock.    I will give it another change just in case but I was not  satisfied with the over all results.,Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50134,10,209,Italian,5,02/25/2023,Celebrated a friend's birthday and we all loved the food it was delicious! I highly recommend this place. The ambiance and decor is too cute and excellent for photos,Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50135,11,209,Italian,2,05/26/2022,"Food poisoning last week and my stomach hasn’t been the same ever since.  I got dinner there last week, I ordered a cucumber mint martini which seem like there wasn’t any alcohol in it, the octopus for an appetizer which only came with 1 piece, and the lamb chops which were good.  It seems like the restaurant is trying to cut cost by offering less of everything and charging the same price if not more.  The meal was way too overpriced for what is and to get food poisoning on top of everything was just a bad experience.",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50136,12,209,Italian,5,06/30/2022,"We have been here many times and the food and service, as well as the music are always outstanding. Today we had a new drink to start, a coconut and hibiscus Margarita. It was gorgeous and delicious, a 5 star drink! After that we share a few appetizers and the pear arugula salad. We had filet mignon and duck as entrees. Outstanding! As good as any top restaurant in Manhattan.",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50137,13,209,Italian,5,05/12/2023,"Came here with a group of co-workers. I'm glad they suggested this place. I always wanted to visit after seeing the Groupon for their brunches. We came here for dinner right when they opened. We ordered some calamari, beef carpacio and arugula salad to start. Our main dishes took a while to come out but it was worth the wait because our pasta was delicious. The only con was that the lobster was a little overcooked and rubbery but the clams and mussels were excellent and so was the pasta. I would visit again.",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50138,14,209,Italian,5,05/26/2022,"1st time dining here. Friendly staff, they would ask us if we were fine or we needed anything else every other 10mins. I ordered the NY strip steak that comes with mixed vegetables, it was great! Also dessert was blueberry cheesecake,  delicious! Recommended! …",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50139,15,209,Italian,2,08/29/2022,"The food was bland. For 90.00 dollars a plate I expected more. It long to be served. Either they were use to a large table or they just didn't care. Never again it was my daughter's birthday dinner. I felt bad for her. The  server Thom I think his name was finally got it together at the last minute smh. I rather dine in the black neighborhood, at least you know whats good .",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50140,16,209,Italian,1,01/26/2023,"The only good thing about this place was the ambiance. Otherwise the food was TERRIBLE!!! The manager has no respect, we wanted to exchange one of the dishes because it was so bland, and clearly not medium well as ordered but the manager insisted that this is the way the food is prepared and forced us to try the food again and stated he couldn’t do anything about it as if it would make a difference!!!! He then proceeded to tell us that he thinks the kitchen is closed yet still he went to take another tables order right across from ours. NEVER AGAIN !!! Very disgusted by the service at this restaurant. I wish I could give them less than zero stars.",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd

50142,18,209,Italian,5,06/30/2022,"Had a great birthday brunch at Rustica! Although it was rainy, the decor and ambience was still beautiful. The unlimited mimosas and sangrias were great and the food was tasty! We weren't the biggest fans of the crab cake but definitely recommend the shrimp appetizer and pastas. This place is great for birthdays and date nights!",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50143,20,209,Italian,5,04/26/2023,What a beautiful place to enjoy a meal. The food was incredible. The artichoke hearts appetizer is not to be missed. I had a shrimp pasta dish that was loaded with huge shrimp and a delicious creamy sauce. The service can’t be beat. It’s perfect balance of making sure your needs are met without hovering.,Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50144,21,209,Italian,1,05/19/2023,"If I could give this place 0 stars I absolutely would. service is horrible. we did reservations for  outside and when we arrived it took us over 1 hour and 5 people to get outdoor seating. since they were already annoyed not 1 person checked on us, gave us refill on waters. was told there is no manager. food was bland and definitely not worth the price, AT ALL! overall bad experience. would not come back again.",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50145,22,209,Italian,1,01/26/2023,"It seems like my post was deleted but I will keep posting until it remains. I dined in on Christmas Day to celebrate my boyfriend’s birthday and although my food was good my boyfriend didn’t like his main dish he said it was too bland no seasoning. However that is merely the worst part of the night. Our waiter was Tomas, mid way while ordering he asked if I would like to know the price of the food before I kept ordering. I found this to be offensive, disrespectful and distasteful as a waiter. I assume if I were white I wouldn’t  have been asked that question. I am a young black woman who is financially established to dine in at an upscale restaurant without being questioned about my financial limitations. With that being said I was upset the whole night but I still kept my composure but my boyfriend and I didn’t not take any pictures to capture and celebrate his birthday because we both felt uncomfortable. I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone especially of color or anyone young of color.",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50146,23,209,Italian,1,05/19/2023,"I would not recommend this place to anyone. We made reservations and were seated an hour after we arrived. Whenever we would ask for updates the waitress would get an attitude and say soon. Once we were seated, it took an additional 35 mins for drink orders. Another half an hour passed and my husband asked for our drinks and the waitress got upset. Not once were we asked if we needed anything. I overheard two of the waitresses saying how annoying the customers were. The food was mediocre, but every staff member we encountered was rude. Never again!",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50147,24,209,Italian,1,05/19/2023,My daughter made reservations days before Mother’s Day. It seems this people overbooked. Didn’t have enough tables for all the people that were waiting for their tables. The hostess were rude and never apologized. They didn’t know what they were doing. Later they gave us a table where it was cover with a clear and dirty plastic tent and the sun was burning us. Imagine yourself seating at this table with your grandkids. No way! We decided to leave this unpleasant place.  I didn’t get to eat but from what I saw food service looked ok. Nothing amazed me.  For sure I won’t recommend this restaurant for special occasion because they don’t know how to handle many people.,Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50148,25,209,Italian,5,02/25/2023,Lovely ambiance and even better food. Every item we ordered was absolutely delicious esp the tomahawk steak. They also had live jazz music which was a nice touch.,Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd

50150,27,209,Italian,1,05/26/2021,"I came here with my husband for dinner in Jan 2020 and was very disappointed in the food.  The food has no flavor and is very bland.  Today, I decided to give them another try and I went back again for bruch with my daughter. Let me just give them a 5* rating on the ambiance... so beautiful the way they have it set up...and the live music was really nice. So kudos to them for doing that right!!   Now back to the food. To begin,  They gave us 2 rolls with stale butter!!! Not a very good start!  The mimosa my daughter had was pretty good.  Then comes the food we ordered.  My daughter ordered the Frittata.  The menu mentions it was supposed to be made with 3 eggs. Wrong. This was only 2 eggs.  Which is not a big deal if it was actually a Frittata.   What she got was an open face omelet that was flatter than a pancake.  Someone needs to tell the Chef that a frittata is cooked in the oven and basically looks like a quiche.   Very disappointing.   Next, I ordered the French Toast with strawberry compote and toasted almonds.  First,  the French toast was very dry and no flavor.  The almonds were not toasted,  they were just sliced almonds.  And let me not even get started with the strawberry ""compote"".... that was a joke!  They give you cherry jelly with 2 tiny strawberries mixed in.  Im not sure if they actually have a Chef cooking the food or a  Dishwasher!!! Needless to say, we left there hungry and and will never ever go back there again. And  what's sad is That my daughter's friend's mother called and asked where we had brunch because the place looked nice and she wanted to book her daughter's bridal shower there and we said absolutely NOT!!",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50151,28,209,Italian,5,05/26/2020,I went to Rustica for an event and I must say it was such an amazing experience the food and the service were fantastic. I must say my two favorites were the main course the blue fin Tuna and the Double Cut Pork Chop! However all the other dishes were also amazing can't go wrong with any of them!,Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd

No attentiveness. no ambition to see that were okay. Over priced. Food was not even that good. Wont be back again.,Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50154,31,209,Italian,2,05/26/2021,"Super excited to try this place, the pictures made it seem like it was more of a lounge revibe but if you do want that I would recommend sitting in the back open area, as the main restaurant area is more of an intimate setting. Parking is a bit hard to find however I did hear that they offer valet but that was not the case when we arrived. On the specific day we went it was really cold outside which should not have anything to do with the temperature inside of a restaurant, however this was not the case for this restaurant. We literally had to have our jackets on because of how cold it was in there, it was as if the heat was not working. The decor is definitely nice, but that's it. It seems like the hype of this place being upscale does not show in the food.    We tried some of their drinks which were tasty. We had two appetizers one was the tuna tartare. This tuna was not bad but not the freshest I've had, the flavor was that of too much soy sauce and the presentation itself was falling apart.  We also tried the baked brie, which could have been warmer in my opinion, but nothing extraordinary.  We also tried their duck confit risotto, and was extremely disappointed. The risotto was watery and not the creamy risotto you would normally expect to find, it also had a salty soy sauce type flavor to it. It tasted like a salty duck broth was poured on top of the risotto and quickly mixed in. To top it off there was fresh apples on top which sounds line the perfect pairing, but sadly for this dish it's a 10 for innovation and 0 for the actual execution.  There were not many people seated but there are also maybe only three waiters so having to wait is something you should take into consideration. It seems everyone that goes there just orders the steak so maybe that's what this restaurant is well known for but I asked two couples behind me what they would rate the steak and they stated a 3 out of 5.",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50155,32,209,Italian,4,03/27/2023,Came here for a surprise party and used the new covered back patio area. Very nice and warm despite it being early March. Food wasn’t too bad. The Bartenders however… not great…,Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd

The service was attentive and friendly. Our party ordered filet mignon, tomahawk steak, penne w grilled chicken and lamb chops. The grilled chicken was overcooked/dry and a bit bland. The tomahawk steak was delicious and we also enjoyed our salads and apps. Not sure about the drinks since we ordered bottles of wine. Wish they had better wine selection. The cheesecake was ok and so was the tiramisu.",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd

50158,35,209,Italian,3,05/26/2021,Beautiful restaurant but no mask compliance  such a shame.  Thank you for your response. I appreciate it. The staff were wearing masks tho not all correctly. 80 percent of customer's going in or out to the restaurant or restrooms were not. I have my own business and spend all week ensuring compliance at my place of business. In you out once a week during such stressful times I am looking for a night off from that. The food and ambience was truly exceptional and to feel safe is non negotiable for me as a customer. I look forward to trying the restaurant again.

50161,38,209,Italian,5,05/26/2020,"Great bottomless brunch. Food was great. Ambiance was like a hip NYC lounge, with an interesting detail everywhere you looked. Dessert fell short of expectations but for everything else 5 stars.",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50162,39,209,Italian,5,05/27/2019,"Came here to celebrate my friend's birthday and the food and atmosphere was on point! I had the penne, but each of my friend's got a different dish and I tried all of them! It was truly a wonderful tasting experience.    I'm not a huge fan of octopus, but the octopus appetizer changed the way I perceive octopus now.    Unfortunately, the filet mignon wasn't cooked at medium rare as requested so the waiter brought us another order. If you do plan to order the filet mignon, do take caution. The second was absolutely delicious so moral of the story is that some risks are worth taking.    Pros:  - interior design and atmosphere was stunning  - food was nothing short of absolutely delicious  - waiters were very professional  - lovely spot for a date    Cons:  - wait time (probably took longer because I was with a group of 10)    For food recommendations, follow me on Instagram @dailymealhabits",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd

They don't skimp on the liquor in the mixed drinks and the live music adds to the vibe.  The food is OK.  It's just OK.  Some options taste premade/frozen or from a can.

50176,53,209,Italian,5,10/28/2022,Vasar was an excellent waiter and attended to our table many times. Never an empty glass of water and had a great personality. Food overall was excellent and our group enjoyed the charred octopus and the Burrara salad for an appetizer. Duck was also great and the chicken was cooked while being very tender. The only thing I can suggest is for a dimmer ambience. That would make the food match the environment.,Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50177,54,209,Italian,1,05/26/2022,"This was the most disappointing experience I have ever had at a restaurant. To make it worse today we went there in an attempt to celebrate Mother's Day. We had reservations for 630pm and walked in to a crowd waiting to be seated. They claimed that open table had double booked and there were no tables, even though I reserved days in advance. We did not have to wait too long. We went in after 15 minutes to be seated on the semi outdoor area which had little to no heat. From pictures I really thought we would be in for a special experience but it wasn't anything like the pictures. The tent had holes in it and the decor was falling a part. I still  wanted to give this place a chance since the reviews were good for the most part. We then ordered our food and drinks at around 7pm. Around 745 pm  we heard the table next to us ask about their food. They had gotten there before us and their food never arrived. The server was frustrated taking to the manager and pointed at our table saying the same thing will happen to our table. They just ended up leaving. One table finally got food at this time and it was such a scarcity that people clapped for them. I asked our server if he could check on our food and when he returned he said it would be ready in 10 minutes at 810pm. He then attempted to stall by bringing condiments and saying it was just being plated. Another 20 minutes passed and the server said that the food he thought was ours belonged to another table at this point it is 840pm.  He claimed his manager was supped to come talk to us but no one came. It this point we are worried about my diabetic aunt who has not eaten yet. We decide enough is enough and decided to leave. Without any acknowledgment from the manager at all we paid for our drinks and left. We are now at a diner having an amazing dinner. I wish my experience was different.",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd

50182,60,209,Italian,4,07/30/2022,The food was excellent everything from the appetizers to the dessert.  I was just a little disappointed in the staff They made quite a few mistakes even though they rectified everything with the smile Maybe I'm very critical because I used to own three restaurants but they are either very new or very unaware. Somebody asked if they had a certain drink and the guy confidently said no they don't have it meanwhile it was on the menu when I looked. Food is excellent service needs improvement.  However I would go again,Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50183,61,209,Italian,2,09/28/2022,"Tried this place because of the ""skylight garden"" and live music, but will not be going back.    The ""skylight"" is held together by failing duct tape and the jazz trio seemed great, but unless you were seated right in front of them inside, you can't hear a thing.  There are no speakers outside and it's silent.    What we really couldn't get past, though, was not being given water until after our apps arrived,   and not getting our cocktails until after our apps had been eaten and cleared.  Two drinks. One was wine....    Tomas, our waiter, half-heartedly apologized once for the delay (after we asked where they were) and then walked away.  The drinks were not removed from our bill either.    The $19 scallops small plate has 3 puny scallops not nearly worth the cost. And my husband's steak came with a single smashed potato, which was just downright funny. Meanwhile, my chicken arrived completely cold.    The warm bread roll was the best thing I ate all night. (Also delivered after our appetizers, naturally...)    If the waiter had been anywhere in sight we would've informed him of the cold chicken, but he vanished for another 30 minutes, so we asked someone else for the check and left to go get ice cream.",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd

50190,68,209,Italian,5,05/27/2019,"Beautiful, new restaurant with live music and a delicious menu. I took my wife here for her birthday and they treated her like a queen..!! They sang her a birthday song as they brought her her favorite dessert (tres leches cake) and they put us in a beautiful table right in front of the fireplace. The food was delicious - definitely try the pulpo (octopus) appetizer - but the ambience was what really made the night. We will be back..!",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50191,69,209,Italian,5,05/26/2021,Great place! I was able to make reservation for 8 using the Opentable app. They followed COVID-19 regulations. The server we had was great. Food and drinks were on point. Overall a great time spent at the Rustica Restaurant & Lounge,Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50192,70,209,Italian,1,06/30/2022,"Absolutely horrible, pre-father's day brunch was a complete bust. First the strawberry daiquiri for my fiance took about 15 mins after the drinks for a party of eight was already delivered. Second my order of pancakes was delivered about 10mins after everyone else's orders were served which the server stated they were coming through the door. Upon arriving in front of me they had no walnuts as described and worst they were mushy and disengradged into a piled of discusting stuffing. What hurt the most was that the so called manager questioned the fact that someone brought it to his attention where he answered that's the way they're cooked, totally unacceptable to any patron to consume. Later he re-visited the table to apologize and offer me something different to eat but the damage was already done. I would not accept a glass of water from this place and will never revisit or recommend this dining establishment.",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50193,71,209,Italian,1,05/26/2022,"A friend of mine made reservations for a holiday dinner. We were a party of 11 and our reservation was for 7 PM. I arrived at 8 and most of the party were already present. We all ordered, minus two people who weren’t present. It was 10:30 PM and and we were still waiting on our food. It was over a 3 hour wait for the people who were on time and a 2.5 hour wait for  the others. The waiter was super nice and was attending to our party with drinks and appetizers in the beginning. When we inquired about our entrees, he let us know that 2 chefs had been fired recently; he had no update on when we would eat. At that point we decided to ask for the bill and to leave WITHOUT EATING. When the bill arrived, they charged $17 per glasses of wine! Just outrageous! They ended up comping the wine because that just wasn’t a fair charge.    Overall, very poor experience at this place. I would not return. I’m thankful I ate 2 dinner rolls in the beginning otherwise I would have gone the entire night without food.",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50194,72,209,Italian,5,05/26/2022,"From the moment we walked in we were greeted by a pianist & bass player creating such a nice ambiance. The interior of this place is very nice; beautiful wood work throughout with an elegant, rustic decor. Our server, Alex, was amazing; attentive, provided good recommendations, friendly. We ordered the calamari & ceviche to start and both were very good. We both had steaks and also very good, cooked exactly as we ordered. Dessert was tiramusu which was also very tasty. I ordered a few different martinis and although very tasty, also very little alcohol. Other than that, everything was perfect. We'd definitely come back again.",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd

50197,75,209,Italian,1,05/26/2022,"My family and I went on Mother's Day for lunch around 3pm. We waited way too long for bread- one piece for each at that. Our server did not inform us of a kids menu option, as were clearly with a minor that could've benefited from that option. We were told it was too late to change the child's 10oz steak order that she settled for (even though it was 5-10 minutes after placing an order). The food took forever, some plates arrived cold, the portions were relatively small, the steak plates were overcooked, and the outing was overpriced. There also seemed to be a change of menu but not all tables were offered that option. The manager did not seem to address the issue properly and we were truly unsatisfied. I will not be returning.",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd

Service was really poor, our waiter never came to check on us, we always had to go get him or flag him down to order something. The food was absolutely not worth the money. Some of the people in my group ordered dinner options and the majority of the dinner entrees are around $30 or more. If the food was delicious, then I could understand why the portions were so small (steak/salmon) but it was not...at all. My friends and I won't be returning.",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd

50204,82,209,Italian,3,11/27/2022,Nothing special when better choice of  restaurants in the area for same pricey menu. Service tries hard and friendly but a bit less coordinated than should be the cause possibly due to young servers low wages not seasoned.,Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50205,83,209,Italian,2,09/28/2022,"Food was the worst part of my experience here, but the way the restaurant looks is nice including the live music that they have which is why I gave the two stars. They don’t season their food enough and didn’t serve my group all together. Penne vodka wasn’t worth it and the size of the steak definitely wasn’t worth it.",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd

50207,87,209,Italian,1,05/26/2022,"I do not recommend this restaurant. It has an adorable ambiance however the service was terribly slow, as it took a very long time for drinks to arrive. The server forgot to put my order in, and they told me they’d comp a drink. Once I got my drink I took a sip and noticed glass was on my lip and saw that the glass was chipped. My plate was terrible and other people from my table agreed. The food was either over cooked, very dry, had a small portion, completely undercooked, or lacked flavor. They should do better especially on a Saturday night",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd

50213,93,209,Italian,4,05/26/2022,"This is my second time there, I preferred the first time because we had the patio and the jazz band and our waitress was taking great care of us. Today's waiter was handling many tables at the time so..... The food was once again great but smaller than during the summer and the mimosa to die for. At least I experienced brunching on the patio and inside.",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50214,94,209,Italian,4,05/26/2022,"I took my Honey out for his birthday last night, & I gotta say we really enjoyed ourselves at this restaurant!  I didn't get any of the staff, or the managers' names, but everyone was so friendly, & attentive to our needs. They even sang Happy birthday to my Honey!  The ambiance was beautiful & the food was flavorable.  However,  the only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because they said there were heaters in the outdoor section, but it was still cold out there, & although they brought both of our plates to us, my Honey's food was blazing  hot, while my food was luke warm. It was almost like they had my food on the side, while they were waiting for HIS food to finish.  It still had a lot of flavor,  & I knew I wasn't gonna finish it, so I just ""doogie-bagged"" it, so I can heat it up the next day.  Overall,  I had a wonderful experience there. I would definitely visit again.  An I would definitely recommend this place to my friends!!",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50215,95,209,Italian,2,05/26/2022,"2 stars due to the waiter being friendly and the decor was pretty nice. Besides that the food is mediocre and overpriced, the vibe and attitude is trying to be upscale but coming up way short. They sat us, wife and daughter, in the back room (it was only us back there and there were plenty of seats available in the front) next to a fireplace which was nice but 5 minutes later the fireplace turns off, the back doors were open and it got cold enough that we left as soon as we were done with our entrees. I asked a lady and later a man that worked there if they could turn the fireplace  back on and they said they would but didn’t. Last thing was the employees not working were by the bar and very loud, it was tough to block them out and enjoy our meal. I was expecting a much different experience but unfortunately this place couldn’t deliver.",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50216,96,209,Italian,4,05/26/2022,Food was good. Beautiful plating. And very nice interior design. I will be coming back. Had an extremely pleasant waiter named Tyler. Complete gem of a worker.  The only thing is the food expedition was a bit slow. Tyler was actually the reason why me and my wife weren't upset. All they need to do it get more chefs to help expedite and they will have 5 stars from me.,Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50217,97,209,Italian,1,05/26/2022,"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER, DO NOT GO. There are plenty of other restaurants in the area, go to those instead. This place is absolutely gorgeous, unfortunately that's all it brings to the table (literally!). I went yesterday (12/17/21) for a reservation of 10. When I arrived, I wasn't greeted by the hostess and when I was acknowledged I was told to wait a second while she proceeded to appear to not do anything. I got to my table and all seemed well, we ordered at around 7:00pm. We then proceeded to wait 2 hours for our food to come to the table with no communication from the staff. We only received an update on our food when we asked. The waitress's response? Our food was taking a long time because it was being DEFROSTED! I should also mention that when our food finally arrived, all our food was brought out at different times. A couple of dishes came at around 9. The next couple of dishes came at around 9:30. The last and final dish came out at 10, when most people were already done with their meals! The food was bland and dry. My pasta was undercooked. My friend's pasta was burnt around the edges. We asked to speak to the manager at around 9:00 and he did not come to speak to us until 10. He was unapologetic and my friend who spoke to him said he reeked of alcohol. Not a surprise considering the service we had received.",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50218,98,209,Italian,2,05/26/2022,"We first dined here just before the pandemic hit in March 2020. It was AMAZING! We were eager to go back for the first time Nov 2021. I was worried that the chef had changed and menu would be different. Waiter reassured us that the menu changes but not the chef. Clearly he had no idea. THAT WAS NOT THE SAME CHEF!  My worst expectations were correct. My lamb chops were hard and rubbery when I asked for them medium well. I couldn't eat them, but the food took so long to come (1.5 hours) I was happy to eat the potatoes and spinach. Spinach tasted as if they burned the pot beforehand. The clams looked as if they were already half eaten before we even started, and the calamari was  just ok. It was an expensive meal to be unsatisfactory. The waiter was polite but very busy and didn't come check on us as we were finally served. So I couldn't even return my meal, so had to pay full price for it. We raved about the spot and were embarrassed to bring family from out of town this time to be so disappointed. :(",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50219,99,209,Italian,1,05/26/2022,"Went here for Valentines dinner, they seated us outside in a tent in less then ample heating... The chicken was no bigger then a patty you would expect from McDonalds and the fish was so dry you would gag on it...The vegetables had absolutely no color and bland. For 300.00 + tip, this was the absolute worse place I've ever eaten.",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50220,100,209,Italian,1,05/26/2022,"Please read the recent reviews before spending your money here!  Wait time is horrendous and our server was just as bad. Our party of 8 waited 2 hours for our food and when it was finally ready the steak was over cooked and there were missing food that we ordered. Server was super defensive and argumentative with the guest which was unsettling. Food took so long we were not even hungry anymore and just wanted to get out of there! The atmosphere and decor is very beautiful but unfortunately service and food sucked. You also get charged $20 pp if you miss or cancel ur reservations.  Pros: Live jazz music, valet parking and scenery.",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50221,101,209,Italian,1,05/26/2022,"This has been such a horrible experience, our party really regretted coming here.  Upon arrival the manager declared that there was an issue with open table and that the app kept letting people book even though there were no spots. Despite that we were able to get a table as our name was on his list. We sat down, the server took our drinks and appetizer order and left, we only received the appetizers after waiting for an hour!!! We spent a total of 2.5 hours waiting for the main course which never arrived and ending up food to go from a different restaurant in town. Seriously this is disappointing and absurd. They are severely understaffed which If you are so understaffed then don’t let people in. If the open table issue was legit, apologize to those who can’t be accommodated but at least we wouldn’t have wasted 2 hours waiting for food that never came.  Other items to call out: plates and cutlery were dirty, we requested standard seating indoors but due to their open table commotion we got seated outdoors, and it began getting really chilly and this place barely has outdoor seating and none near our table.",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50222,104,209,Italian,1,05/26/2022,Under and over cooked food. Reservation was at 1215 and didn't get out food until almost 3pm. The food was under cooked and the pasta was over cooked oily. I will not be coming back to this place ever again. The worst experience ever at a restaurant. I'll never be coming back there and to top it off the table broke on us and spilt food and wine over my family.  The staff kept saying it's cause of the holidays but there were empty tables in the place. The bathroom are not well maintained.,Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50223,105,209,Italian,1,05/26/2022,"Think about the worst service you’ve ever received and imagine it 10 times worse. Our reservation was at 7pm and our food wasn’t served until 10pm,  we asked for the manager multiple times, turns out his chef left and two others quit. Instead of closing the kitchen and being transparent with the customers, they continued to seat even more people and delayed our services. The manager was so incompetent he decided that he would take over the kitchen and cook; and with no surprise, it turned out he’s a horrible cook and an even worse manager. Every single dish arrived came out flavorless, cold and RAW. The chicken was severely undercooked and still raw inside, none of our orders came as described on the menu.  We requested the manager multiple times to give him the opportunity to explain and address the lack of service. When he finally came to our table he was rude, unprofessional and unapologetic. I would not recommend this place at all, trust me, I know the ambiance is cute, but it’s really not worth getting food poisoning and salmonella for it. Find cute vibes somewhere else.",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50224,106,209,Italian,1,05/26/2022,"Went out with friends for a celebration dinner and it turned out to be the most memorable dinner I've had because it was the worst.  There were 10 of us and we put our order in around 7:30 PM and didn't receive food till an hour later.  They only served 1/3 of the group.  More food came out another hour later and more food afterwards.  Isn't food supposed to come out at the same time, not hours apart? The first group who got their food had already finished! Then they forgot about one of us and took another hour to bring out their food.  Completely unacceptable.  There were other large groups around us who were suffering from the same service.  One of them came over to our group and said they were served under cooked chicken.  I cannot put any blame on the staff.  I know they were trying to be as accommodating as they could under the circumstances.  I think this restaurant is incapable of operating at full capacity and the owner knew that.  He was in over his head.  If you are short staffed for the night, please stop accepting patrons.  You probably lost future customers and definitely me and my friends.  The only positive I can say is that the restaurant is beautiful and has a nice ambiance.  It has a lot of potential.",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50225,107,209,Italian,1,05/26/2022,"Waited over an hour and a half for mediocre food. Waitress didn’t approach us. Ordered drinks, everything took forever to come. Didn’t even receive bread which should’ve come with the table. When we asked for bread, she only gave 2. There were 3 people. Didn’t offer any incentive for our wait. We were actually told by our waitress that she avoided us because she saw how visibly upset we were. I think we were upset for a good reason, waiting to be given food while other tables that came after us were eating and even leaving in the time span that we were here. Will not be back, do not waste your time. Promise you, your 12 year old can cook you the same tasting pasta, bland and overpriced.",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50226,108,209,Italian,1,05/26/2022,"this place has so much potential but wow the service was awful. i don’t blame the waiters but i definitely do blame management. we were a group of 10 and had a reservation at 6:30. we ordered at 7 and when we noticed how long it was taking we asked the waitress why it was taking so long and she said it was taking a while because of the frozen-ness of our food. half the table finally got food around 9. then the rest of the table got their food half hour later and STILL one person didn’t received their food until 10 (she ordered an appetizer! not an entree). we asked for the manager 3 times and the waitress told us he was busy with other people and that he had our bill. finally he came over and reeked of alcohol and was barely apologetic. we watched two tables leave without eating because of the wait. we are never coming back!!!! PLEASE go somewhere else, the food wasn’t worth it at all.",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50227,109,209,Italian,2,05/26/2022,"I went here Friday night, I had Penne alla Genovese, the food lacked flavor it tasted only like plain cream, the chicken was not seasoned at all.

50228,110,209,Italian,1,05/26/2022,"Absolute trash. We booked this place a month early for a party of 8. At first you enter in, the entire furnishing of the restaurant is inviting and impressive. There was an outdoor decoration that was also really amazing. Other than the furnishing, they really need to hire a better staff. We waited 2 hours for our food. We sat there from 8pm and finally had our food at 10pm. The waiter wasn't even busy and he didn't wait on us. Our water glasses were empty for the longest time. When we asked about our food, they brought it to us 5 minutes later. I'm positive he forgot about us. We weren't seated in the back. We were seated right in front of the entrance. Everyone can see us. How do you forget you have a party of 8? They also refused to accept our coupon for $35 from yelp. They forget us for 2 hours and expect us to pay in full and with tip? No thanks. Anywhere else is better.",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50229,111,209,Italian,1,05/26/2022,HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! Beisar the manager could care less about addressing our issues at the restaurant. I called in advance before driving almost 3 hours to celebrate my sisters birthday with my sister and mom and was highly dissatisfied when we sat down and were told there was gluten free options and there was not! The only options we could have gotten at any other restaurant but we specifically came here for their Gf pasta option and dessert that they claimed were not in stock due to them not receiving shipment. We were not told when we sat down and specifically let them know my sisters who’s birthday it is is allergic to gluten and soy. The manage comped my sisters beverage and did not apologize or seem sorry at all. With the prices we payed we expected higher quality service and will not return or recommend this place to anyone we know. Also used the bathroom before leaving and it is disgusting.,Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50230,112,209,Italian,4,05/26/2022,This restaurant has a really cool vibe.  Our waitress Sara was excellent.  She made us feel at home and was very attentive.

The meal was delicious well prepared and decorated, the seasoning was well balanced. I had the linguine fra diavolo which was delicious and not too hot/spicy. My lady had the Pan Seared King Salmon Which was prepared right not over cooked or dry and was really tasty. Now, the cocktail, these people have it down to a science, it was perfect great taste and we'll balanced. Overall this place is great for all occasions.

50234,117,209,Italian,1,05/26/2022,"First time coming here with a girlfriend. Rustica had great reviews on Google to say the least and pictures Made it look really nice especially the skylight winter garden room we both were very curious and honestly excited to try a new place out. Valet attendant was super friendly. We were Seated and our server was also friendly and attentive. We place our drink orders, they were good. Then we proceeded to order our small plates which were the Charred octopus, petit Brie plate that were paired with figs and flatbread crisps, big eye  tartar came with Italian toast. Let me just say that I have never been so disappointed in a restaurant on a Friday night before, the flat bread crisps and Italian toast both were so stale that I thought I was going to break my teeth on them. The octopus smelled so bad it was unbearable to even have it sitting on the table. It’s a shame there are employees working there that are super friendly and nice and are serving the public this kind of food on a Friday night the place was not busy and there should have been no excuse that the chef nor the manager takes count of inventory to see what is expired/old. We told the waiter our concerns and he said that he would call the manager and the manger never showed up seems like they don’t care. Place has potential but not serving expired and stale food.",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50235,118,209,Italian,2,05/26/2022,"It was just okay. Very disappointed by the service . Waiter came every once in a while to see how my table was doing. The drinks weren’t as good as they looked . The waiter never asked why my friend didn’t even touch her drink at all. Mine tasted like pure rubbing alcohol & ice. The crab cakes were okay no real complaints there . However , our entrees i wasn’t satisfied with at all. I ordered the shrimp and lobster pasta. Me personally don’t think vodka sauce and lobster mixed well . It would’ve been nice to have some condiments on the table . Also, they charged us for water…",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd

Live music added tremendously to the overall aesthetic of the place. Friendly staff and valet parking available. Sadly, place is poorly run in some areas. New staff every week it seems. Something is wrong. Needs to be fixed immediately with so many high quality restaurants in the area. Ownership needs to take accountability asap. Tread wisely.",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd

50239,123,209,Italian,2,05/26/2022,"Posting here since I sent this to Rustica directly with no response.  I've been 3x - two were great but the last was atrocious followed by mgmt ignoring my contact attempt.    Message sent to mgmt with no response in 5 days:    Hi, will be short and sweet.  I'm a repeat customer but had a weekend reservation for the first time Sat 2/12 at 8:30pm.  We ordered by 9 but didn't receive dinner until 1030pm.  All facets of our visit were wildly delayed (drinks, apps, entrees, check, & dessert).  One meal was hot but the lamb dish was cold.  Both meals were missing named ingredients (cherry tomatoes and nuts on one and the menu says five lamb pieces but I only received four) and I have pictures, if desired.   My two previous trips made me anxious for the 3rd but this was a nightmare.",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd

50241,127,209,Italian,5,06/30/2022,Dante was an excellent server and made our experience one of the best dining experiences I’ve had in recent years. The food was divine and the service was amazing. I will returning with my family regularly.,Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50242,128,209,Italian,5,06/30/2022,Carlos was our waiter and he was Amazing!! It was our first time there and all of his recommendations were so good!!!! The ambience was very nice and the staff was so friendly. I definitely recommend this place.,Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50243,129,209,Italian,5,05/26/2021,The best steak I've ever had in my life. Worth the money. The entrees are above the average price but this place is way above average. The service is exquisite and always on point. Drinks are made to the liking and your satisfaction guaranteed. The location has an outside dining option but it is very well put together that you may not even feel the cold at all cause of the heaters and also the construction that is well put. During covid regulations this place is on point and has temperature checks when you get in and staff is always with masks on. The tables are spaced out perfectly and have dividers to separate them even better. The restaurant is a 6 star restaurant this 5 star isn't enough compared to the service given here. Would always recommend to everyone.,Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd

My waiter Carlos was very knowledgeable about the menu and offered some great choices of food and drinks. I definitely recommend this place as a place to come to.,Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50246,132,209,Italian,3,05/26/2022,The experience was ok. Visited the restaurant for my sister in laws birthday. If you go you'll drive right past it. Its tucked in  between 2 buildings very easy to miss. You must use the parking service. No on street parking anywhere. But if course this is Jersey. Jazz band for entertainment. Set up outside or inside use with canopy covering but sealed all around to prevent bugs or weather from disturbing your meal. Staff a little confused. I gave my one name they took us to another parties table. My food was great. The steak was juicy and tasteful. Other parties dinner not so great. The food came out cold and had to be sent back. When arrived second time the disappointment was apparent even when hot it didn't taste well. Scallops for appetizer was really good seasonal was great. The staff was trying there best but often would forget something we asked for. I don't know know if it was because that night everyone was celebrating a birthday or if they're normally like that.,Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50247,133,209,Italian,1,05/26/2022,"The food was absolutely horrible! WAY OVERPRICED! for the worst tasting food! For example we got a seafood tower with hardly any seafood on it! Just lots of ice where shrimp,  clams and oysters should have been!  Crispy artichokes not crispy, soggy and tasteless! The worst fried calamari- gummy I almost choked! Grilled octopus could not even chew it! Had to pardon me, spit it out!  Our waiter was very nice but don’t go there for the food, RUN! I’m so sorry we spent so much money !    #OVERPRICED  #FOODSUCKS I will never go back! ZERO STARS!",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd

50249,135,209,Italian,3,05/26/2022,"We just left actually, but our waiter was hands down the best we’ve ever had, i love seeing people comfortable around me and my family, I enjoy being able to be myself around strangers and TYLER definitely made us comfortable. It was honestly the best service ever. We did go there because we had found a Groupon, which in no way makes us poor, but when it came time for the check the manager, who’s name I honestly don’t remember, was gaslighting us. Yes we read the fine print, but along with the the fine print we asked for clarification before we ordered. We were told we wouldn’t be charged for dishes under a certain amount and the other dishes over, we would be charged the difference. Yes we went over, yea we understood everything. That was fine. What was not okay was at the end of the meal the manager proceeded to argue with us. No voices were raised. When  mymother asked to go to another room so it wouldn’t be any distraction and he denied it and although we were calm he continued the conversation by stating my mom was causing a scene. He was most definitely attempting to rip us off. At the end of the day, I’m thankful for our waiter and our great experience, thank you Tyler.",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50250,136,209,Italian,1,05/26/2022,"Honestly, really wanted to like this place. The ambience is good, but the food is miserable. Which wouldn't have been such an issue if it wasn't so expensive and you didn't have to wait over an hour an a half in a freezing cold tent outside for it. This place clearly has operational issues.. they told us after waiting 90 minutes for our food that the chicken rollitini was no longer available. They weren't even that packed (now I know why) and they stuffed most of the customers outside in a barely warmed tent. Not at all worth the Manhattan prices.",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50251,137,209,Italian,1,05/26/2022,"I walked into Rustica and was immediately impressed by the decor and atmosphere, boy did that change quickly.    Service: very poor.  We couldn't get refills of our water or our drinks. Dirty plates stayed on our table, nobody checked on us once the food arrived, I asked for sauce, it never came.    Food- terrible! We ordered the seafood tower and while it looked good it certainly was not, the clams and oysters were tiny and very grainy  full of sand. The crab meat was imitation crab mixed with something like mayo, it was more like a tuna salad. When I told the waiter about the oysters and claims he made reccomendations of other restaurants that had better quality oysters!!    Calamari- terrible, must be straight out if the freezer and of poor quality.  The breading was falling apart once you picked it up. No flavor, and absolutely terrible.    The Cats- stray cats were running through the restaurant, jumping in tables and on top of place settings.  The waiters would chase them away but never clean the table or replace the dishes that the cats were walking on.  I feel bad for anyone that used those dishes    For the first time in my life I brought up these concerns to the manager and his responses assured me that I would never come back to this place and it should probably be shut down",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50252,138,209,Italian,1,05/26/2022,"I honestly don't like leaving poor reviews but they earned it. Be prepared to wait...forever...for anything. Legit 30mins for a drink. 1 1/2 hours for apps. Another hour for your entre. And quite frankly, the food sucked. I ordered a filet medium n it arrived well done not even a hint of pink. Tragic. They charge 5 star prices and provide Applebee's quality at best. And to top it off ladies, the facilities are horrid. Safe to say I won't be back   I will say, the live music was enjoyable",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50253,139,209,Italian,1,05/26/2022,"I don't know whose fault it was, the service was horrible. Sat down for almost an hour, wasn't even served water. We ordered the charred octopus as an app, we waited about 45 mins and it came out cold. Then we waited some more, to the point where we canceled our main course and just paid and left. Food never came. Got there at about 8:45 left at almost 11 PM, still hungry and pretty annoyed.    All I'm saying is if you can't run a kitchen dinner service, maybe tell people before they make reservations and spend 2.5 hours sitting down waiting for food and service that never  comes.",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50254,140,209,Italian,1,05/26/2022,"Honestly, the restaurant is gross. Used to come here a lot for our favorite server Tomaso but management and food has been absolute trash recently.

50255,141,209,Italian,1,05/26/2022,"My wife bought a groupon for our anniversary.  It was the pasta groupon which was 2 pasta dishes( Up to $26 each) , and bottle of wine (Up to $32).  The funny thing is that there are no $26 pasta dishes.  There are $19, 23, and 25 dishes.  All the other dishes are $27 and up.  I asked if I could pick the $27 pasta dish and pay the difference, and was told no.  The bottle of wine was some no name brand that I looked up at the table, and found for $4.99 at bottle king.  We ordered an app of fried calamari, and it was pathetic with half the coating sitting in the bottom of the bowl.  It came with three dipping sauces..ketchup, and 2 sour cream based dips.  Disgusting!!  Now the pasta dishes come out.  Mine porcini mushroom ravioli, and that was terrible.  Overcooked ravioli and a cream sauce so rich it was nasty.  My wife ordered a pasta dish that was cream based with chicken, and when hers came it looked like a salad with grilled chicken on top.  The waitress Sara explained that it was in a pesto sauce, and that they were in the process of changing the menu, and this was the replacement!!  Never once did she tell my wife about the change!

50258,144,209,Italian,3,05/26/2022,The ambiance is nice and our server was very attentive. Food is very salty as one of the reviews mentioned but it’s not the worst thing in the world. We tried sitting outside but ended up getting bit by mosquitoes so we asked to be moved inside. The biggest thing that made us uncomfortable was NONE of the staff is wearing mask. We also had one staff that sat by the bar area which is right to our table for a good amount of time (not wearing mask). I would have given it less stars if it wasn’t for our lovely server!,Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50259,145,209,Italian,1,05/26/2022,This place was very Gorgeous and beautiful. Melissa was the host she has a very soothing personality. Herby was our server and he was enthusiastic about sharing how innovative his manager has been about adapting to Covid and understanding this new way of life at his restaurant. However I am upset because I had received this group on as a gift for my bday and I did travel for it. I had mentioned this to the hostess also at the beginning and it wasn’t till the end after we ate that I was notified that to use this group on I needed to spend 99$ on food.  . Who eats that much?

50262,148,209,Italian,1,05/26/2022,"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I should’ve known when we walked in and saw 1 other couple seated in the restaurant. Our waitress didn’t know anything about the Groupon we had, so she had to ask the manager. She came back 10 minutes later (still no water at this point) and explained the Groupon very poorly. We ordered a bottle of wine, which took 20 minutes to get (they were trying to find it). My boyfriend ordered a beer and that never came. It took another 25 minutes for bread. Finally, the tomahawk steak for 2 that we ordered medium rare came out VERY well done. It was such a shame. The mushrooms had no seasoning and the mashed potatoes tasted like they were from a box. They offered a plate of steamed string beans and red potatoes - the potatoes were still hard. The waitress ignored us almost the entire time; I am not sure why, as there was no one in the restaurant on Monday at 9pm. Water glasses were never filled. Terrible food, terrible service. Save your money and don’t go here, even with a Groupon.",Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd
50263,149,209,Italian,2,05/26/2022,Really wanted to like it but the food was just OK and steaks terribly overcooked. The hostess who greeted us was very friendly and the overall ambiance was nice. I ordered the 6oz filet and my husband had the ribeye. We ordered both medium rare and they came out medium well/well done. We are not ones to complain or send food back but did mention it to our server when he asked how everything was and he just nodded at our response. Our water glasses were mostly empty the entire dinner. The resturant has potential but in desperate need of a new meat thermometer and some customer service training.,Rustica Lounge Bar & Restaurant,565 Gorge Rd

56725,7,248,Italian,3,12/27/2022,"We had a party at the Mulberry restaurant, the food was great and the staff was pleasant. However, I have to say that the owner was beyond unprofessional and argumentative which ruined the whole experience. When we planned the party we did not know that there would be Christmas decorations in the restaurant. Considering it was themed birthday party for a child party we felt that would have been nice to know that many of the decorations would be hanging from the ceiling. When our concerns were brought to management and the owner, we were met with an argumentative and rude demeanor. We were asked to list the other Italian restaurants that did not decorate the restaurant in the same fashion. Instead of working towards an amicable conclusion we were met with the sentiment of oh well, it is what it is. Although the food and the staff were great the management and the owners behavior towards us will assure that they won’t receive anymore of our business.",Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave

We had agreed on a price for 70 people. If 50 people showed up, I would have still paid for 70 as it was agreed price. He then proceeded to charge me for 79 people for over $300 above agreed price even though there were 77 people!! Regardless, I should NOT have been charged that extra 9 people on the day of the event. When I realize what he did AFTER the fact and I called him, and told him, he said he would call me but he didn’t.

56733,16,248,Italian,5,11/27/2022,"Straight away.  I am so grateful that Mulberry Street was open on  Thanksgiving!    I erroneously thought another venue that we previously planned to go to was open but oops, they were not.    ENVIRONMENT:    About the restaurant.  It is definitely an ""intimate"" atmosphere"" since you are in close proximity to the other tables ( and screaming kids).  However. It's fine.  It's a holiday, so it's a bit of a different vibe to it during a holiday.    The atmosphere is very cozy.  It feels warm and comfortable.  It feels like enjoying  a holiday meal at a larger version of grandma's dining room only with more modern and classier decor.    APPETIZERS/ENTREES:    My partner had the buffet and she loved it.  It was quite impressive.  She's thin, and polished off three plates.  Nice.    I know, it's Thanksgiving.  However, I ordered the Lasagna Bolognese.  Our server challenged me to finish it.  He won.  It was a huge portion. And it was delicious.    The only issue was with the shrimp cocktail.  The shrimp were huge, but they were very tough.  Hard to chew.    DESSERTS:    Fan-freaken-tastic.  My partner had a variety of choices from a dessert buffet.  All fresh, creamy, fluffy, outstanding.  I loved the pumpkin pie.    SERVICE:    I believe it was the owner I spoke to.  He was very gracious, professional, and kind.  Great personality. A great guy and I am so thankful to him for making arrangements for seating us without a reservation.    Our waiter was very nice with a warm personality. Unfortunately, there were several issues with service.  They are those annoying, lingering issues that  you just let go at the time so you can go on with your meal, but unfortunately cause you to ruminate later.    Normally, at a restaurant of this caliber, the server is a little more proactive and does not require prompting on most basics such as bringing out warm bread, plates, and water to the table.   We asked twice for bread, but it never arrived. I guess he forgot. It really wasn't that hectic. When I was a server when I was way younger, I know what hectic is. He also didn't check in on us to follow up on the meal.  My partner wanted a drink.  She is very sophisticated and didn't feel like running or having to get up to track him down. I am going to assume he is very new or inexperienced. Quite honestly, the table was bare because he didn't have any plates to remove because he rarely checked in on us. I even had to ask him for a coffee and dessert menu.    OVERALL ASSESSMENT:    Despite the service hiccups, Mulberry Street is a wonderful restaurant.  Excellent and diverse menu with many entree/dessert/appetizers/beverage/aperitif choices, top notch food and ingredients.  The whole restaurant was well designed. Clearly the kitchen professionals were carefully curated as it shows in their final product. Very quaint and cozy atmosphere.  Warm setting.  The owner is a thoughtful and smart person.    I most definitely be coming back here.  I was searching for a higher caliber restaurant with a more comfortable atmosphere and overall setting.    Very happy I found you!     May see you guys soon!",Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave

However, in all the time that I’ve been going there the menu has remained the same. I’m getting bored -  sometimes I don’t go there because I know it’s the same old thing   I think it’s time you guys try to change it up. Having a daily special Isn’t enough. You need to regularly change the to keep people interested.",Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave

56739,22,248,Italian,3,09/28/2022,I started going to Mulberry Street about five years ago when you actually saw the chef on the floor. It seems now to help the servers the bartenders have no direction and no authority seem to be very chaotic for a very small crowd of people. A lot of servers and such just sitting at a table in the dining area where the guest are eating Which I find very low class. When I first started going there the food was delicious it seems now the menu never changes it’s always the same the last three meals I have there I literally was unable to eat. About three months ago I ordered the pork chop which was absolutely delicious I ordered the pork chop just a week ago was a completely different texture the glaze was water down and it just didn’t taste right. I’m not sure I’ll be back for a while,Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave

56741,24,248,Italian,1,09/28/2022,"3 of us went  to diner Friday Night and  the  food  quality was  substandard, A friend loved the  vodka  sauce and  hence we  ordered  that, the  colour of the dish was   different than usual and the chicken  was cut in   squares and  was    tough and  rubbery. The other 2 dishes  we ordered  a  riggatoni  and a  shrimp dish was   not  good  either. The  chef  changed or  something was  not right. the  saving grace was  the  sangriya and  the  crepes  as  dessert. The  dishes  are  expensive and  we  spent good  money but  felt  cheated. Will NOT be  returning. Would like to be  refunded what we  spent or get a  credit so can go back for  desserts and a  drink at least",Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave
56742,25,248,Italian,4,05/26/2022,"Met some friends for dinner and was happy with the menu items offered. My lamb osso bucco was tender and the red wine reduction gravy was very tasty.

56744,27,248,Italian,1,09/28/2022,"What a disaster. Do your self a favor and read some of the negative reviews. They’re telling the truth. We were not offered any thing for a horrible experience. Chef was arrogant and cocky. Food was undercooked. We had a fish dish, a chicken dish and a pasta dish. With the economic troubles you think they would have have a giving a free dessert or taken something off the bill. Nothing. The wait was extremely long. Waited an hour for bread. Bread that is like Melba toast . Not even real Italian bread. So disappointed some one said so many great things about this place however it wasn’t our experience. Would never recommend nor go back again",Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave
56745,28,248,Italian,2,05/26/2021,"We have been here before and haven't had any bad experiences. We also tend to order pick up from here a few times a month.    We had an 11 AM reservation for Mothers Day, sat with no issue. We had 2 young kids with us. The restaurant was not packed, nor half full.  It appeared to be fully staffed. From 11:10 to 12:10 we sat with only one glass of water each while waiting for our food. By 12:10  after asking for a status on our food, it started to come out.  The pancakes we ordered weren't fully cooked.  Because of the already hour wait and the undercooked plate, we decided to leave.    Unfortunately, we sat near a table with another family who was experiencing similar issues, as we overheard their complaints.    It's a shame because we have eaten here before and have experienced their delicious food. If an establishment cannot handle breakfast/ brunch that is ok and only offer items they specialize in.",Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave
56746,29,248,Italian,4,05/26/2022,"Ive lived in avenel for years and had never tried this restaurant. Today my wife suggested we give it a shot. We ordered and had it delivered. We had the three color salad  and white wine mussels for an appetizer. The salad was great and the mussels were awesome, large, fresh, and not drowned out with garlic like many other places.  For entrees we ordered the pork chop, which i must say was an incredibly tender, french cut, medium well treat of a meal, and the chicken ripieno. The chicken was absolutely fine, but was missing the prosciutto described on the menu, which was a shame because that was the salt that seemed was missing from the dish.  We ordered dessert which there may have been a glitch in the ordering app we used but only received vanilla Gelato instead of pistachio, but having said that the vanilla was absolutely wonderful.  Overall a good experience with a few minor improvements needed to really tighten it up to a 5 star. We will go eat in next time for the 100 percent experience.",Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave
56747,30,248,Italian,2,05/26/2021,"I was here last night celebrating a 40th birthday, a group of 9 people. The PROS first  We got seated right away. The staff was good with the putting the cake away and accommodating our request to bring it out later. The food was good, the lamb and pork chops where amazing. The drinks were mediocre. We actually sent back the sangria as it was too sweet.    CONS  The food takes forever to come out. The worst part however for us was that for a large group this size, it takes a bit to order the entrees. We placed the order for appetizers within minutes of being seated. Our waitress (a young woman, looked new) didn't once feel the need to tell us that she will not put in our appetizers until all the entree orders were in. So we practically wanted 45 minutes before our appetizers even came out. I have never heard of this before. And again if that is the rule fine, TELL US.  Then later during the cake time we asked them to cut us small pieces which probably fell on deaf ears so we asked our waitress to pack the rest of the untouched cake slices. 10 minutes later the manager comes out to tell us - she left it on the counter, went to go get the boxes to pack it and during that time the bus boy threw away all those pieces. So half of our untouched cake was in the garbage. Overall, the service is very below average. Considering we spent close to $500 I would expect the manager to comp us for something at least.",Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave

56749,32,248,Italian,5,05/26/2021,"I must say, the food here is very good and the portions are huge. I definitely left with a full stomach. I highly recommend the appetizer platter that comes with the rice ball, calamari and the mussels. It is well worth it. The wait staff is very nice and if there are any problems with your food, they make sure to fix the issue. I'll definitely be returning.",Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave
56750,33,248,Italian,1,05/26/2022,"We went here with another couple with reservations on Saturday Feb 12th. We got there 15min early, plenty of tables still. We ordered drinks, then appetizers, all ok. When our Appetizer order was taken, she asked are your ready for dinner order, or should I come back, we said ""We are all ready"" she took the order. We got our appetizers on time, they were good, we had Calamari and soup. Then we had an issue, 2 of us wanted to leave after we seen 3 couples come in after us and they got their dinner before us. So, instead of leaving I said, let me talk to the manager, we spoke and she knew right away ""who"" I was and the table we were at. I mentioned to her its been 1hr and 40mins in with no dinner and mentioned about the other 3 couples getting their dinner before us, she said 2 min we'll have it out. We'll it came out after that and not sure why our friends recommended this place. Guess I was trusting of them. We'll they have a not so good recommendation for us, going forward. Getting comped for desert, doesn't cut it. Even after we were billed $10 for a peach Bellini, which our friend said somethings wrong with this and we sent it back for the valentines Love Potion punch, which was way better. If the manager told me, hey we had our chef get sick or something truthful, I wouldn't be writing this review. However when we seem to get BS, then here is this review. Lost 4 future customers and our friends that go to dinner in Woodbridge area.",Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave

My wife and I catered from Mulberry Street for our child's birthday party, and not only was everything delivered, on-time, and was exceptionally good, but we had a sick child the morning before and had to push the party - but Chef Paul was very flexible and allowed us to push our order to the following weekend. We are so grateful to have had such a positive experience, and to know that customer service is not dead. My sincere thanks to Chef Paul and the team at Mulberry Street, and suggest anyone and everyone to make a trip there and experience the quality & quantity we so greatly enjoy!",Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave
56753,37,248,Italian,3,05/26/2022,"This was our 1st time going there in a group of 4 for an 8pm reservation. We went specifically for an event featuring the episode with Chef Robert Irvine. The service took long and the waitresses were clumsy and disorganized, and the place wasnt crowded. They spilled some beer. Spilled the sauce from the clams appetizer all over a part of the table. They did offer for us to switch tables but we opted to just stay where we were. We ordered all different dishes and while most were okay.  None were something Iwe would decide to return for. When they brought they food out finally after a long wait, they only brought 2 plates. After a while someone finally came back and asked if everything was okay, and that was when they realized they had forgottento bring out 2 dishes which they soon after brought out. I guess were closing so they were rushing us even though 2 of us had basically just gotten our food. They did offer dessert once they cleared our plates but more as a formality because they were cleaning around us so we decided to just leave. Not sure that it's a place we will go back to.",Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave

I don't blame the wait staff they brought out the appetizers quickly, drinks were no delay...but the main entrees from the kitchen were very slow. One of the dinner's at our table was missing so they made up another for us. Funny thing is that 2 guests got the same meal.. when the 2nd came out, it looked completely different than the first. I'm not sure what it was intended to look like, but it looked very different from what I've know and cooked Chicken Marsala to look like. I wasn't super impressed with the eggplant Parm...eggplant was sliced extremely thin..like a thin chicken fillet, it was very dry and not like traditional eggplant Parm.",Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave

The restaurant was not busy, the staff was practicing social distancing indoors and we were seated far enough away from the next party. I felt very safe dining indoors. We ordered rice balls and a cheese board to start, and each ordered a dish. The meals are big enough to share!

The food selection is very good. We have never had a bad meal. They have different specials each night. The shrimp and garlic are always good. I had the chicken parmigiana the other night melted in my mouth. We always enjoy going there.,Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave

56764,48,248,Italian,2,05/26/2022,"The epitome of fake ""fancy"". We ordered the ""International"" cheese board as an appetizer, they brought what seemed like ShopRite brand cheese: Provolone (seriously), the cheapest gouda imaginable, and what seemed like a very disappointing manchego. Then our entrees came hardly any time after we got the app. She got the lasagna, I got the Chicken and Shrimp over Rigatoni. Her lasagna was clearly topped with deli sliced sandwich mozzarella (you could make out the shape, and again, this screamed ""ShopRite"") and was barely luke warm. My meal had tough, overcooked shrimp and varying degrees of warmness throughout the dish. Clearly both were microwaved. Stay away from this place. It's a glorified Olive Garden.",Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave
56765,49,248,Italian,1,05/26/2022,"Go to another restaurant for better food and faster service. We went to this restaurant to eat pizza, but once we were seated and ready to place our order, we were told that they weren’t making any pizza’s that day due to too large orders coming in (maybe due to a private party taking place, but still no reason to suddenly not offer it). Our main purpose was to eat pizza mainly due to our son wanting to only eat that. We were ready to walk out when we requested if they could make an exception (a decision we came to regret once we received the food). The pizza crust wasn’t properly cooked and tasted bland (no amount of Parmesan cheese or crushed pepper could do the trick).    Do yourselves a favor and avoid eating here. Not worth the price for the quality of food.",Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave

She always has a smile on her face and makes you feel comfortable and important, whoch is nice in a busy restaurant like this. The food is fantastic! Drinks are cold or nice and hot depending on what you order. Prices are good for the amount of food you receive. I order my food to go and it always comes out fast and hot. Very friendly staff and the owner, Tina, is absolutely awesome.  Very personable and makes sure she goes around greeting the guest.

Typical italian fare, chicken parm was overcooked. Had a special menu but items weren't available. Had to always ask for water refills. Not much attention paid to the table considering the place was empty. Many nicer places in the area for dinner. Avoid this one!!",Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave
56774,58,248,Italian,3,05/27/2018,"Food is good. But the wait is horrific. We waited over an hour for our dinner and the poor waitress kept apologizing. At the very least, they should include a salad with the meal to give patrons something to eat while waiting.  Prices are high enough that a nice green salad could be included.  Not sure what the problem is with the kitchen, but something needs to improve.",Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave
56775,59,248,Italian,1,05/27/2019,"Just ate dinner here with my husband and two friends. Food was not the reason for this poor review, the waitress who served us is the reason we will never return. My husband and I both ordered a soup but the waitress suggested we share because they are big, so we agreed. When the soup came she only brought one spoon, so we asked for another and she told us we couldn't have one. We laughed because we thought she was joking, she then told us ""you're husband and wife right? You can share."" My husband asked if she was joking and she said no, she refused to give us a spoon and walked away. Waitress didn't bring us bread. We asked her for bread she brought it when we were almost done with dinner and no butter. Not a good experience.",Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave

Well, as we arrived we looked to our left and there was a party being held and to our right was another large group. the bartender couldn't really give us a time of when we were going to be seated and really wasnt helpful. How do you offer these deals but then book parties and can't serve anyone else. This place is already too small! If we do return it may be to just use our remaining balances of our gift card and probably will just do pick up. Sad because the food is good! Guess we gotta find a new place.",Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave
56779,64,248,Italian,2,05/27/2018,Place is nice. However everyone says there is a wait to get your food. We waited over a half an hour for appetizers which was the cold antipasto. We also got the crab cakes. You only get two on a huge plate of lettuce and tomatoes which was probably the best part of the meal. We got the chicken and shrimp rigatoni. Wouldn't recommend it at all. It's served in a brown gravy like sauce. It was not that great. For dessert dessert got an $8.50 cannoli... would have been worth it had it not been hollow inside. If you like very good Italian food this is not the place. I gave it to stars because the atmosphere and staff is very friendly. But the food was not worth the wait.

Meal took three hours, and they brought my daughter, who is allergic to all nuts, a dish that had nuts on it.  We decided to have our confirmation party here for our daughter.  We went  a few weeks ahead to have dinner to try out the place.  The food took over an hour to come to the table.  They promised this wouldn't happen at the party.  At the party, each course took 45 minutes and the entire meal was over three hours.  Guests had to stand up because they were so sore from sitting in the chairs for so long.

Called Friday to have delivered Sunday by 3pm. Called at 3:30 to check on the status and hostess said her mistake she wrote down 3:30. Arrived at 4pm. Tray of Caesar salad and dressing on side was good. Nice tray of cold antipasto. Tray of bread and a half tray of lasagna. The lasagna was not good. The meat in the dish was like shredded steak instead of ground meat and without any sauce on the side it was mostly tasteless. Also a tray of dessert but the cannolis tasted like they were soaked in rum or maybe it was the chocolate chips. Virtually no cream in the shells. Hope my order helped them in these tough times but next time I go with Highland Pizza.,Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave

Hostess took care of reserving and booking our event for April 24 for 20 -24 people while ensuring cdc distancing protocols were met. We maintained contact periodically and a week before my daughter's shower she confirmed those arrangements with me. Three days before the event, I received a call at home at 9:15pm from a man identifying himself as chef/owner Paul, who scolded me for not leaving a deposit and signed contract. This was the first time I had heard such a thing.  In addition I was advised by him that the private dining area was given to another party of 35  plus. I was told my party of 20 could dine in the small lounge area  which was totally unacceptable and unsafe. I had to scramble and find another venue to accommodate  my party at the last minute. Paul never admitted his wrong doing but blamed me, his hostess and everyone else. I will never dine here again nor recommend Mulberry Street Restaurant to anyone else. Bad business practices.

56791,76,248,Italian,5,05/26/2022,"What a lovely local restaurant to meet family and friends conveniently located to NY and Central New Jersey. Food is home made and delicious and desserts were terriffic! We enjoyed a family gathering and the wait for our dinners extended our visit time together. Staff was super accomodating and they offer a Gluten Free menu which is why we chose Mulberry Street Restaurant in Woodbridge, NJ.",Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave
56792,77,248,Italian,5,05/26/2021,Our waiter Ryan was as wonderful as the food.  We had the chicken franchise and lobster ravioli.  The crab cake appetizer was delicious.  Ryan was attentive and very professional it was a great night out.,Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave

56794,79,248,Italian,5,05/27/2017,"Go with my wife, we've decided to try out this Italian restaurant I've found online - Mulberry Street Restaurant. Right at the entrance we were pleasantly surprised there is also a pizzeria right at the entrance - the smells were astonishing ! somebody was with us in couple seconds, asking us if we would like to sit at a booth or table. We've decided to go with the booth. It was quite crowded and a little bit loud because of some party in the middle of the room, but not in a bad way - it made as feel cozy and comfortable. Waiter was really polite and funny. He explained what are today's specials and after we've heard his recommendations, we've placed the order. Menus looked like straight from Venice - beautiful art on both sided and rustic look. Huge variety of meal choices and wines !  We did wait for food quite a while - like 30 minutes, but like I said, the place was really crowded that day so I believe it's understandable. While we were waiting, waiter brought us some fresh bread and butter and a salads we've ordered. I'm not a fan of breads, but these were so fresh, I couldn't stop myself !  When the waiter brought us our order, I was surprised with the size of the plates. I remember the prices from the menu, and I've expected to get much less food - another pleasant surprise ! Plus everything was really fresh and still hot. I promise You, You won't leave that place hungry.  Again, waiter was very thoughtful during the meal - he was asking couple times if everything is to our liking - but not too many times, he was not bothering us at all. The room we were in, was quite spacious and with all the noises around we've spend really great time there. That was EXACTLY what we needed.  I was keep glancing on the beautiful bar on the south wall, but I knew I couldn't drink as I was driving. Just worth mentioning that there is one and it's got everything You could possibly think of. After we were done eating, waiter asked us if we would like a dessert but we were too stuffed to possibly fit anything else.  Along with my friend, we can't wait to come back there again.",Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave
56795,80,248,Italian,1,05/27/2019,"Last night was first and last time there. We were a party of 7 that was sat down and weren’t initially given menus.    Our waitress, not sure if she was new or what but wasn’t familiar with the menu whatsoever. Service also wasn’t great, everything occurred over long periods of time. From being asked what we wanted to drink, having our order being taken, to having our entrees being brought to us after waiting for over an hour.    I was highly disappointed with the quantity of food I was given for the price I paid. First we ordered a Cesar salad that was completely over dressed so we paid 8 dollars for something we didn’t eat. Next 2 orders of Mozzarella en Carrozza were ordered that were completely drenched in grease!    I ordered Chicken Francese that was advertised to be served over potatoes and vegetables, I paid 18 dollars for 1 small piece of chicken breast, 6 potatoes and green beans.    When I read vegetables I assumed an assortment of mixed vegetables not just green beans and I HATE green beans!    Overall we spent well over $250 dollars on a place that was nothing but disappointment! Even more disappointing was the fact that the waitress that barely cared about our party got over a $45 dollar tip!!",Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave
56796,81,248,Italian,3,05/05/2023,Very confused. Maybe because they were overwhelmed.,Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave
56797,82,248,Italian,3,05/27/2016,"I want to give this restaurant a higher rating.  I really do.  However, the last three times we went, we have had some of the slowest service I've experienced in any restaurant.  Our last visit, dinner took over an hour to arrive from the time we ordered.  If the quality was outstanding, I would let it slide.  But, recently it's just been good, and nothing to rave about.",Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave
56798,83,248,Italian,5,05/27/2018,"Great atmosphere, great wine selection, large portions. Ask for a recommendation on the food if you're unsure. I found a few things on the menu that looked appetizing and asked my waitress. She helped me decide from there.",Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave
56799,84,248,Italian,5,05/26/2020,I really like the vibe within the restaurant. The decor is very homey. Only have ever been here for dinner and I have zero complaints. Their calamari as appetizer and chicken parm entree is my go to. The one thing that keeps us (me and my girlfriend) coming back is how accommodating they are with their gluten free menu (for my girlfriend). She always leaves here very happy since many Italian restaurants don't always have such vast gluten free options when compared to Mulberry Street. We've done take out once and the food still held up great upon unpackaging. Still crispy and delicious!,Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave
56800,85,248,Italian,5,05/28/2014,Have dined here a few times and always enjoyed the food. Chef Paul if very creative in his entrees. His specials are recommended. The service is always excellent.  One of the best Italian Restaurants in New Jersey. Highly recommend.,Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave
56801,86,248,Italian,5,05/26/2020,Been there a couple times. Food is always excellent!! Paul the owner is busy but will take time for any customer. Calamari always fresh. All the dishes I’ve had have been delicious. Highly recommend this restaurant!!,Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave
56802,87,248,Italian,3,05/26/2021,"It's.... Just ok. The food was fine, a bit old fashioned and odd (I asked for a side of Penne with Alfredo and they added peas and tomatoes....), the service is friendly but not great.  It took 10 minutes plus (I'm not kidding) every time we ordered a drink. 30 minutes to get water. My friend asked about the pizza and the waitress said ""it's not available Saturday"" I said it was Friday and she goes ""oh it's ONLY available Saturdays"". Yadda yadda yadda my other friend who came late asked if wanted to add a pizza for the table and she again said ""not available on Saturdays"" I said it's Friday then ""oh! Yeah it's available today!""   All told the 4 of us spent almost 4 hours there not by choice.  Just everything took forever.",Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave
56803,88,248,Italian,1,05/26/2020,"Sat right near the bar and podium, and was ignored and forgotten about for an hour and a half. No one knew who was supposed to be our server and were too distracted to find out. Food was descent. It was 80's night and the wait staff seemed more interested in partying than serving. More than once we didn't see our waitress for so long that we figured she forgot about us. The dj was late setting up and unless you sat in the corner with the dj you couldn't hear the music.   We went to Mulberry Street to escape for a bit, turns out we should have escaped from Mulberry Street. Sad performance for a restaurant that is so pricey.",Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave
56804,89,248,Italian,5,05/26/2020,"Once again, another fantastic experience at Mulberry Street.  We went early on a Saturday night and enjoyed a delightful meal...scrumptious salad, delicious penne pasta followed by a decadent cannoli.  Yum! The ambiance is so charming and comfortable.  Our server, Maria, was a sweetheart. We still highly recommend this place!",Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave

56806,91,248,Italian,5,05/26/2021,Can't say enough about chef Paul and his restaurant.  He made me the best birthday dinner. Veal chop spinach and fish risotto. Great dinner from drinks to appetizers dinner and dessert. Too bad I couldn't post pictures,Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave

The risotto was bland, and the chef came out, and spoke with us.... It was reassuring to see someone who had pride in their food...    Other then that there were plenty of seafood in their cooked perfectly.    *I had to up it to a 5... On our way out the chef insisted we stay for a dessert.. It was delicious...    We will be back before we leave...",Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave
56810,95,248,Italian,5,05/26/2021,"One of, if not, THE BEST Italian restaurants I have been to in a looooong time! Great antipasto, amazing entrees, (eggplant parm, riggatoni bolognese, chicken marsala) and incredible fresh-baked-on-premise desserts!",Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave
56811,96,248,Italian,5,05/27/2017,"Nice atmosphere. The service is always excellent. Bread comes with oil and spices, not butter, nice touch. Dinners are always excellent. One of my go to places. Highly recommended.",Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave
56812,97,248,Italian,1,05/28/2015,"Place looked very nice. Portions looked large. What was missing was the taste.... worst italian food I ever ate. Olive garden is gourmet food compared to what they serve here. The sauce was absolutely tasteless.  The veal left an ""old cooking oil"" taste in your mouth. The bread was stale and dry,served without butter.  no wonder it was Empty on a Friday night.",Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave
56813,98,248,Italian,4,05/27/2017,"Very nice atmosphere.  The food was fair/good but it is kind of difficult to mess up pasta and salad.  One time I got the pizza, and again it was okay.  They should have bought the recipe from the previous Mayfair owner.",Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave
56814,99,248,Italian,5,01/26/2023,"Attentive wait staff and a nice selection of menu options. Meals were prepared just right and served timely. Beer selection and adult beverages are ample and should satisfy.  Available only for dinner as far as I know, but if you're in the area I can tell you you'll love this place.",Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave
56815,100,248,Italian,1,05/26/2020,"Went to Mulberry Street on New Years Eve for dinner before going out to meet friends at Halleys Pub in Metuchen.    Sat down for a 7:00pm reservation at 7:45. That’s ok, we get it, it’s a busy night.    However, what we don’t get is not seeing our servers for half an hour. And when we questioned why our entrees still hadn’t arrived after an hour and a half, we were given an excuse that sounded a lot like I forgot.    We told the service to shelf the order. We weren’t exactly on a schedule, but at the same time, didn’t allow 3hrs for dinner. We had to leave, without eating.    So, to sum up, 2 1/2 hours spent at this restaurant and no meal. I can’t think of any meal worth going out for if you don’t get fed.",Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave
56816,101,248,Italian,4,05/26/2021,Good italian fare with some unique dishes.  Rigatoni with chicken and shrimp has a brine champagne sauce that is excellent. Cream of mushroom soup is a great appetizer and for dessert try the mulberry crepe.,Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave
56817,102,248,Italian,4,05/27/2019,"We went early on a Sunday night and it was pretty quiet. I liked the atmosphere, the service was lovely, and everyone enjoyed the food. The bread they brought to the table was toasted and perfect! We also enjoyed sharing the cheese board appetizer.  On a personal note, and why I can't give it 5 stars for me, I was disappointed that there were only two vegetarian entree options: your choice of pasta with your choice of sauce or an eggplant parmesan. I had the eggplant and it was fine, but I would have appreciated more choices because it's not really what I wanted. For example, offer a vegetable option with the pasta/sauce dishes or a mushroom ravioli. A vegetable version of the zuppa di pesce could be amazing if you pick a fun combo of vegetables and change them up. The rest of my family want to go back and try other things, but there's nothing else for me to try.",Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave
56818,103,248,Italian,2,05/26/2021,"Covid curbside pickup turned into going inside and waiting by the bar.  All the servers were wearing masks except for one person..the owner,,, who walked around with nothing until I called him out.  Received my food went all the way home and then discovered they gave me the wrong order.  Went all the way back...owner no mask again until he saw me.  Had to wait for my order to be prepared...owner offered me no discount for my inconvenience or time just told me to keep the already cold food they had already given me in error.

56820,105,248,Italian,1,05/26/2021,If you like waiting forever for your food you’ll love this place we sat down at 7:10 the food didn’t come till after 9. They have rice balls on the menu when we ordered them they said we are out. The place wasn’t even busy veal was old it was definitely microwaved my little cousins filet mignon wasnt cooked like he asked it was also extremely tough I just don’t know why our food took so long do yourself a favor and go out to eat somewhere else this was brutal,Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave
56821,106,248,Italian,1,05/27/2019,Walked out after food not coming for 40 minutes. Final straw  was a waiter walking into my wife's  chair.  We asked for the manager. The owner wanted to find out why we didn't  have our food. It was a shame  Heard good things. But very disappointed.,Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave
56822,107,248,Italian,5,05/26/2020,"For valentines day, my wife and I decided to go to mulberry street for the first time. From the second we walked in, we were treated like family. The hostess/ our server  , alisha, was spot on. I essentially told her what my wife and I like to eat and she sent out the absolute best items. The spinach salad, the bolognese and that veal osso bucco.... all homeruns! For desert, she  suggested the peanutbutter cheesecake and... honestly? Let me tell you... Save room for desert here. Our peanut butter cheesecake was amazing. We never wanted for anything. Over all, a great experience.",Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave

It's been there for quite a few years so people who have visited it, well it's no surprise I'm sure.  We went for a 5:30 seating  and within a half hour it was packed, with that make reservations!  If your a Zuppa Di Mussels fan, their white cream sauce is off the charts!  The main course, the Osso Bucco is to die for!  Special thanks to our awesome waitress Amber and bus boy Joe, they made the whole dining experience worth going back again and again.......not to mention the cusine of course!",Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave

If you're not looking you can miss it. It's like a bit of Manhattan on the other side of the river. As you walk in the amazing bar is the first thing you see. The smell of good fresh food is a premise to an amazing menu, now here is where I stop. Most of the time I would go into a discription and decour and style and flavors etc...

If it's hard to make then why put it on the menu? They force a 20% tip on you even if the service is terrible which it was. I guess they have to include the tip because after the service they give nobody would give a tip,Mulberry Street Restaurant,739 Rahway Ave

We had a reservation and the dining room was not full, not sure why they made us stand around while they set up our table.  Waiters were rude, the food was nothing impressive. Stuffed clam and stuffed mushrooms were dry, eggplant rollatini was falling apart. I asked for a side order of meatballs and the waiter looks at me like I have 5 heads…and brings me a plate of pasta with one meatball. My veal Marsala had no flavor, just some grey meat with questionable brown gravy. Requests for a pitcher of water went ignored. The wait staff need training on the proper way to serve.

58275,44,258,Italian,1,05/26/2021,"Extremely disappointed with this restaurant! Placed an order for dinner delivery, they took my address and payment, I waited an hour for the food only for them to say we have your food but we dont deliver to your address! Via GPS we are only 20 mins from the restaurant. I called and the manager was very rude and unprofessional said we had to tell him our address was in NJ. I told him that when we called and gave the address it was his responsibility to let us know whether they can deliver to us or not, especially since they were so quick to take payment. We offered to pay the toll, as we waited over an hour for our dinner and he refused to send it. So I guess they rather the food go to waste. It's ridiculous honestly. Upon speaking with the manager and informing him of how disappointed I was with their service and unwillingness to resolve this situation,  he continued to argue and be combative, stating he was canceling the order, he refused to deliver to our address, saying it was our fault. Honestly, if you run a business with a delivery service you know the radius of where you deliver-  but to take the order, charge the card, and prepare the food/ send it out only to say you refuse to complete the transaction it is absolutely ludacris! I have never heard of such a thing. I will not ever recommend this place, in fact I recommend you stay far away. This is not good service, or a respectable business.

58279,48,258,Italian,1,05/27/2019,"The food was good but the service was horrible.  To the wonderful elderly male waiter thank you for the horrible treatment, you've proven there is still racism in Staten Island no matter how much people claim there isn't.  I tried my best to look past the attitude and disrespectful treatment but it seemed like the moment we got there you were displeased you had to wait on us.  You barely looked at us while asking for the order you rushed and told us what we were going to eat then got upset when we had to correct you.  The best was how you slammed our desserts on the table, bravo to you I hope you sleep well at night.  As for the management your apology really meant nothing considering you stood there as the waiter almost pushed my mother as she walked towards the exit.  I give you one star because Google has no options for negative ten stars.",Cafe Bella Vita Italian Restaurant,1919 Hylan Blvd

Rigatoni with Eggplant was at one time whole pieces of Eggplant cooked in the sauce.  This time it was basically cut up pieces of Eggplant patties probably frozen.

58292,62,258,Italian,1,05/27/2019,"Let me be blunt. If it was not for the waitress monica I would report this place. Allergies were told specifically to a waiter who decided not to actually check the ingredients. Thankfully Monica got information correct and the owner or manager switched the table's waiter. Never again for me. And if you have oral allergies stay clear. The staff must not understand the severity of what could occur to the not only the customer, but the reputation of the business.

58983,10,263,Italian,5,01/26/2023,"I am very impressed with Nino’s. This is what the dining experience was and thankfully here still is. My party of two was warmly greeted by the hostess. Our waiter, and all the waitstaff, were polite and attentive.  In fact, the waiter felt like a friend as the meal ended. Water glasses were never empty and flatware change between appetizer course and main course was the extra touch so appreciated. And as expected, the food was amazing. An Italian egg roll sounds odd but was wonderful. Main courses of pasta were equally delightful. Homemade pasta papardelle and superb beef ragu sauce was my choice and it was a generous portion. I’m pretty excited I had to bring half of it home to enjoy it a second time.    What a fabulous experience which I highly recommend.  I’m from Long Island and I will endure the brake lights of the Belt Parkway to return in the future.",Nino's Restaurant,1110 Hylan Blvd

I like how the party room has its own entrance and the open bar located within the party room. It all started with my favorite Espresso Martini.  The salad Insalata di Rucola with lemon vinaigrette is fantastic. The main dish The Oreganata filet de sole was cooked to perfection, and it was a lovely way to cap the night with sweet sweets.

However, I did have some little floating things in my glass of wine that skeeved me out, and we waited a long time for the check so the waiter was kind enough to take our dessert right off the check!

59048,79,263,Italian,3,05/26/2021,"Seems like a nice place. I am a first time customer. I ordered ahead for a pick up. It was holiday catering. The hostess killed it for me. She looked a bit like Sophia Coppola in the Godfather but her attitude was anything but humble. I don't know whether it was the onslaught of people coming in for their holiday pick ups such as myself but she was clearly flustered. But I noticed that she was much more concerned about paying attention to her phone rather than paying customers, such as most rude millennials do unfortunately. This left a bad impression on me. Otherwise the guy who brought the food to my car was nice and I tipped him generously. I even think the owner or manager (guy in a suit) thanked me for my patronage and wished me a Merry Christmas, even while he was running around. That was truly nice and showed genuine appreciation for customers. As for the food, when I got home and tried it I couldn't be more pleased. Delicious and tasty. Had a nice old school flavor and preparation style to it just like I remember growing up before emigrating here with my grandmother and mother's home cooking! I would like to give Nino's another try and dine in whenever that happens. The food and manager/owner saved me from writing Nino's off altogether.

59064,95,263,Italian,3,05/26/2021,"Ordered food for new year's eve.  The chicken Parmigiana was good.  I was super disappointed with the baked ziti.  The ziti.tasted like pasta with sauce in a pan...definitely needed more...and we do not go for overly seasoned...spiced food...it was just bland.  The fried calamari....were rubbery but that is probably because they were not immediately consumed.  Overall, I don't think I will cater from there again...and the excuse that they were busy...does not make up for the fact that the food was ehhh.and the price was oh.",Nino's Restaurant,1110 Hylan Blvd

59067,98,263,Italian,5,05/28/2013,"I came here for dinner recently, had a great experience. Food was great (chicken parm w/ rigatoni pasta and vodka sauce), service was attentive and even the Valet Parker was on point (I walked out the restaurant and my car was ready).    I would recommend everyone to come here and try this place out.    Highly recommend to make reservations in advance. Place does get very busy around 7pm.",Nino's Restaurant,1110 Hylan Blvd
59068,99,263,Italian,1,05/26/2022,Ordered a chicken parm dinner to go. It was burnt. I called they did offer to replace but I don’t live anywhere near the restaurant. The sauce for the pasta personally was too acidic,Nino's Restaurant,1110 Hylan Blvd
59069,100,263,Italian,4,05/26/2022,Very well prepared food. I ordered the surf and turf. The steak was excellent.  The lobster was a little underdone. Service was excellent.,Nino's Restaurant,1110 Hylan Blvd
59070,101,263,Italian,5,05/26/2020,We’re from out of town and our aunt and uncle really recommended this place they frequent Ninos weekly and would be considered regulars. The food was exceptional and the service was even better. They treated my daughter with extreme kindness and attention. If you’re looking for a Family friendly restaurant this is a great spot I hope to stop in next time in I’m in town.,Nino's Restaurant,1110 Hylan Blvd
59071,102,263,Italian,5,05/26/2020,"I would like to let everyone know that this is what authentic Italian cuisine tastes like. I had the best chicken parmesan ever. As a lover of  Italian cuisine the only word I can think of is perfect.  The chicken was very tender,  even the edges. Most places the edges are burned and dry. Don't expect that here. Took my  father and  sister to dinner tonight and will return  next time I return to NYC.",Nino's Restaurant,1110 Hylan Blvd
59072,103,263,Italian,5,05/26/2021,"Only been here twice so and I love it, I had the tomahawk steak which is apart from their regular menu i considered it a supreme steak in my book and I got the steak medium, I ordered that as a main course twice in a row. Tonight I ordered polenta which has a little layer of blue cheese lightly baked over penne vodka which is highly rated by me, I chose as a change from last time from just getting calamari as an appetizer which is consistently amazing as I had got it again on the second time. I wrapped it up with a very tasty irish coffee and a creme brulee must say I had an exquisite experience as the wait staff is prime in there service level and dining level they are well trained to make sure they are handling everything like a upscale restaurant would be doing such as Nino's proves to be from my view point. Definitely going to be a repeat customer.",Nino's Restaurant,1110 Hylan Blvd
59073,104,263,Italian,5,05/27/2018,"Indulge your heart when you visit Nino's.  It is a given that your taste bus will be immensely satisfied with the food.  I had the best ever thick cut, lightly (or was it non-breaded) calamari with a delicious marina.  My husband had the veal piccata with just the right tang!  I had this wonderful chicken, stuffed with spinach and feta with a porcini mushroom sauce ( with large pieces of mushroom)!  But, what really warmed and satisfied my heart was the wait staff, the management, and the patrons.  It seemed that everyone knew each other.  Managers greeted patrons with hugs, patrons greeted other patrons with hugs. I enjoyed watching the woman eating the artichoke and the man enjoying his veal parmigiana and all of the people talking with their hands.  I think there was not an empty table when we left at 7:00 pm and rather parking lot was mostly full, even with their valet parking. If you find yourself in this area of States Island, you really must enjoy a dinner experience at this lovely restaurant.",Nino's Restaurant,1110 Hylan Blvd

The hostess arrive 15 minutes later than when the meeting was supposed start and finally opened the doors to a dark cold restaurant. No service was available until the meeting ended a hour and half later, not even a glass of water. Then she proceeded to have an attitude and became confrontational. During the meeting, vacuum cleaners were going and the bug man was spraying...lol what a joke!!. Never again. I know people in New York and Staten Island can be difficult to work with, but this takes the cake. I would never plan another meeting or dinner there again.

I had the Eggplant Rollatini and my wife had the Vegetable Soup, a nice beginning. For the entree, I ordered the Veal Marsala.  I have been to many restaurants where they have Veal Marsala, but rarely do you really taste the Marsala!  Here, there is a no question that the Veal Marsala is cut wih a fork tender and you really taste the Marsala.  My wife ordered a dish she had not had in the past, Loin of Pork with Vinegar Peppers.  She thoroughly enjoyed it and said she would order it again.  I had Espresso and Tortoni, and my wife had Tea and Tortoni for dessert.  Service is always Very Good/Excellent.

For my entree I ordered the chicken parm which was fresh tasting and had just the right amount cheese and sauce. It came with pasta which was perfectly al dente. I finished off with a honey ricotta cheese cake to die for. The prices aren't cheap but well worth it.",Nino's Restaurant,1110 Hylan Blvd

A dinner for 7 usually costs around $400. $600 for a so-so meal was not worth the trouble.

The following weekend my husband and I drove to Jessica's Cafe and we were turned away because we didn't have reservations.  Went online to make reservations and it's extremely booked!  Finally able to get reservations for dinner in the ""heated tent outdoors"".  Our Server Jonathan was great!  Attentive, courteous and checked in throughout the dining experience!  Food was delicious!  I had the salmon.  The table in front of use ordered the pasta and it was so aromatic!  I plan to come back and order the pasta!  We had a leisurely dinner.  It's BYOB- ""bring your own bottle"" of alcohol.  Parking lot available.  Congratulations on being ranked #40 on the Top 100",Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd
59127,1,264,Italian,3,06/30/2022,"This is by far one of the toughest reviews. My food was good, I had the grilled chicken sandwich with pepper, it came with coated fries which I really loved, however my friend ordered the meatballs as an appetizer and the pizza, unfortunately he didn’t like either. I tasted the pizza and didn’t care for it myself, but I believe it was due to the Gorgonzola cheese. The crust was fine, the cheese just wasn’t my favorite. The customer service was fantastic, the young lady was very attentive, informative and accommodating. I would try the restaurant again but the biggest problem I had was the menu selection; with that said I would try the dinner menu with hopes of having a better selection of dishes.",Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd
59128,2,264,Italian,5,05/26/2022,"Absolutely amazingly flavorful and delicious menu. We are so pleasantly surprised that there is such quality cuisine available close by. If you want to dry delicate and flavorful dishes influenced by French cuisine and don’t need a kilo of pasta in your plate, definitely, this is definitely worth the price.My only hope and comment is regarding the location. I don’t love the location, but keep going back because the food is excellent. I hope that they would consider changing the location or at least expanding the dining room and back yard as well.

Meatball ricotta pizza: it’s very good but I think the other things we ordered were more unique to Jessica’s Cafe and I would rather save stomach space to try their other items.    Shrimp rigatoni: YES YES YES. My favorite of the night.    Milk-fed pork chop: massive portion and super tender meat. Cooked perfectly.    Apricot bread pudding: A perfect savory-sweet balance for dessert.    A few previous reviews complained that portions were too small but I was pleasantly surprised to see a nice, hearty portion. Maybe they listened to reviews and made a change.",Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd
59130,4,264,Italian,4,05/26/2022,"I tried this restaurant entirely because it's so highly recommended on Yelp and Google.  The pictures people share are amazing, but it's no comparison to the food.  It's so delicious that it was hard for me to share it with my family!  The only complaint would be the price, making it hard to order it frequently.  Even though we tried our first meal via delivery service, it arrived hot and the ice cream was still cold.  (I couldn't take a picture of the dessert before I started eating it.  It was impossible due to overwhelming deliciousness.)",Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd
59131,5,264,Italian,4,10/28/2022,"Jessica’s Cafe is an Italian and French fusion BYOB restaurant.  I wanted to try this restaurant for a long time because of all the amazing reviews I read.  The prices here are reasonable, and the portions were all a nice size.  For appetizers we ordered the beet salad and the mushroom and shrimp crepe.  We weren’t that impressed with our appetizers, but overall they were decent.  The shrimp in the crepe you can tell were frozen prior.  I had this appetizer at several other French restaurants where it was much better.  It was very bland, and I wouldn’t order it again.  For dinner we ordered the branzino and the shrimp rigatoni.  The branzino was FANTASTIC!  It came in a delicious red pepper sauce, and it was served over Caponata.  The skin was crispy to the branzino, and it was cooked perfectly.  I HIGHLY recommend ordering it!  The shrimp rigatoni was very good!  For dessert I had the goat cheesecake.  It was very good, but it’s not what I expected.  It was more like a pie than a cheesecake.  It was good like I said, but I wouldn’t order it again because it’s not my type of dessert I like.  Next time I’d like to try the bread pudding or the apple tart.  My waitress was very nice, and we are looking forward to dining here again.  We weren’t impressed with the appetizers we chose, but the dinners and dessert were delicious.  I recommend Jessica’s Cafe in Plainfield!",Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd

59135,9,264,Italian,4,05/26/2022,Delicious but very heavy haha. Everything was full of cream and butter. The food was more french than italian in a way. Foie Gras pasta was very reasonably price. Pizza was way more oily than average but the crust was very thin and crispy. The mushroom soup and shrimp crepes were absolutely delicious.,Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd

59139,14,264,Italian,5,04/26/2023,Wanted to try something new while on a business trip. Honestly the best Shrimp rigatoni I’ve ever had! 10/10,Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd
59140,15,264,Italian,5,01/26/2023,Really rooting for this place. Best food in town! This isn’t a resturant it’s a culinary experience. Every time I’ve dined here I’ve always been pleasantly surprised by how excellent the food is and how great the service is. The food is pricey but completely worth it,Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd
59141,16,264,Italian,2,02/25/2023,"Had a dinner date here with high expectations being high based on the reviews. It is BYOB for those reading which is always cool. Great atmosphere and everyone seemed to be having a great time, but the two stars is the food and the restroom. It was absolutely the most bland food I have had at a restaurant serving food at these prices. Each of our meals were dry, overcooked from what we requested, and poorly seasoned. The restroom was another issue. The urinal was full of urine, the floor had urine on it, the toilet seat had urine on it. Does anyone come to clean the restroom? All and all, the whole experience was underwhelming and I question a lot these reviews.",Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd
59142,17,264,Italian,5,05/12/2023,"I’ve tried many of the appetizers and main courses here. Without exaggeration, everything has been a 10/10.  Everything.    Update :  I have tried almost everything on their menu and they deliver hit after hit.    Updated Update:  I’ve tried their brunch/lunch menu and it’s as good as the dinner menu!!",Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd
59143,18,264,Italian,5,05/26/2021,"What a surprise. The food was really, really, really good. Started with wild mushroom soup. Made with 4 types of mushrooms for a very creamy Autumn flavor that will not disappoint. Next a small cheese pie made in a wood fire brick oven. Crust was fluffy  and crisp with a nice rise. It was cheesy and sauce was homemade. Now the beef short rib pappardelle in a cream sauce. The pasta was fresh. The cream sauce was garnished with peas, parsely and dill. Yes, DILL who would have thought of that. The owner who is also the chef from Albania. The food was so good I had to meet him. This place is byob. A small place. Nothing fancy, but that's okay.  Food was very good and service attentive.",Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd
59144,19,264,Italian,5,05/26/2021,"I ordered online and it was so convenient and easy. I ordered a mushroom panini and let me tell you about this bread. It is divine. Like a slice of perfect pizza, it's crispy and chewy and soft in all the right ways but it also has a ton of flavor; surely the star of the plate. The fries were still crisp after a 10 minute drive, which is pretty remarkable. I highly recommend Jessica's for your workday lunch!",Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd
59145,20,264,Italian,5,05/26/2021,"Found Jessica's on IG, been following them for a while so I had pretty high expectations. As far as the food, Jessica's was the best meal, start to finish, that I've had in a very long time. Shrimp & Mushroom Crepes were prepared perfectly. Just delectable. Tried my daughter's app, Burrata and Rhubarb went so well together. Entree was filet and Foie Gras, again, prepared perfectly. Dessert I had the Apricot Bread pudding and it was incredible. Extremely impressed and I will definitely be back. The combination if value, creativity and quality is unmatched in this area. Someone is working magic in the kitchen. BYO.",Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd
59146,21,264,Italian,5,05/26/2021,"Don't be fooled by its cover.  Outdoor dining is as challenging as anywhere else with converted parking spaces right off a main roadway. Road noise is the new normal.  This establishment is so busy keeping clients satisfied that they probsbly haven't the time to repave the dining lot. Excellent service and food more than make up for these minor issues.  We could see that this place is vary popular among locals. Shrimp stuffed crepe was astounding. Salmon dish was cooked to perfection and creatively garnished. Watermelon Salad is a surprisingly good blend of pear, arugula, vinaigrette dressing around the melon cubes. Scallop barley dish was very filling and tasty. Desserts are fine dining presentations at a fair price. Definitely a big plus upgrade for the neighborhood from the former ice-cream parlor. Great place to take some friends, or celebrate a special occasion. BYOB. Full 3 courses plus dessert, for 2, $125. includung gatuity. Easy off/on Terrill Rd.",Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd
59147,22,264,Italian,4,01/26/2023,"Went to Jessica's with my new jersey family last week and it was very good. Meatballs we're great,Arancini was great ,the carbonara was great. Best looking pork chop I've ever seen. Only critique was my brother in law and I are both pasta freaks and both got pasta ragu and both of our rigatoni were under cooked. I know there is a catch all excuse for Italian chefs to say it's al dente but to never have a range given. It was at least 3 minutes early. Bravo to the sauce and overall meal and I'm sure other things could have come into play like ten people ordered at same time and too much pasta in not enough water will have same effect as wrong cook time. Very good overall and I would definitely return.",Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd
59148,23,264,Italian,5,01/26/2023,By far the best and highest quality food you’ll find in the area. I’ve eaten here at least 6 or 7 times and it never fails to be absolutely perfect. Great service as well and BYOB.,Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd

59158,34,264,Italian,4,05/26/2022,"What kept me from giving this five stars, I felt they were overpriced for the amount of food they give you. I never mind paying the money but I don't want to be hungry when I leave. $22 for about 12 noodles is a lot",Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd
59159,35,264,Italian,5,07/30/2022,"My Wife & I were in the area looking for a nice BYOB. Even though one of servers wasn't our waiter, he took the time to describe his favorites. Our waitress was totally professional and knowledgeable. We were debating on getting dessert and we decided against it. The owner heard what we thinking of and he brought it to us on the house. It was our first time there and we can't wait to go back. It's totally worth the 25 minute drive to us.",Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd

Thank you Jessica's Cafe",Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd
59179,56,264,Italian,5,05/26/2022,We have eaten here many times and have never been disappointed. The white mussels appetizer is always the forest item I check to be sure it's on the menu.

They really care for thru customers well.,Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd
59180,57,264,Italian,5,02/25/2023,"Went to Jessica's Cafe again wth my work mom Lilia, and the food was more amazing than my 1st visit. We ordered the rice balls, meat balls, and grilled octopus for appetizers, I had the market salad with salmon, my work mom and friend both had the shredded beef with a creamy pasta (I had it the 1st time I went also, but forget the name of the dish) Let me tell you!! The chef takes much pride in his food!! From the presentation to the taste..smh..EXCEPTIONAL!!  The staff are all wonderful and so polite! I absolutely love this place! OH!

59183,60,264,Italian,5,05/26/2022,"A home run for sure!  Just had dinner for 4 last night and had to do a quick review before I forget.  The cozy dining room had nice decor and lighting for an intimate night out.  There is also a covered patio area that might be nice during warmer months.  Upon entering you can see the big wood fire pizza oven blazing away.  We ordered 2 appies, the mussels (COZZE BIANCHE) and the wood-fired meatballs.  The sauce for the mussels was so good that we used bread to soak it all up.  The meatballs melted in your mouth and the sauce was very dippable.  We had the pork chops, Braised short ribs and Branzino fillets and let's just say there was little conversation aside from the groans of happiness between bites.  Finished up with a the goat cheese cheesecake and the apricot bread pudding with espresso, and thumbs up from everyone at the table.  I guess you can say the menu was small but not limited, and everything was done superbly between the taste and presentation.  Servers were super friendly and helpful with food suggestions and special accommodations.  You don't get 4.8 stars with 300+ reviews by accident.",Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd
59184,61,264,Italian,5,05/26/2021,"We went to dinner for the first time last night, and the food at Jessica’s Cafe was nothing less than spectacular. Everything we ordered was plentiful, fresh, imaginative, and delicious. We have a family member with food allergies, and there were plenty of items on the menu to accommodate him as well. The burrata is out of this world, and my son loved the salmon entree. Prices are very reasonable for the amount of food and especially the quality. This restaurant gets very busy, so make sure you have reservations. We will be back!",Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd
59185,62,264,Italian,5,05/26/2022,"It is rare that I write reviews of places, but with restaurants still struggling to get back on their feet, I feel it's important to call out the really good ones. I went to Jessica's Cafe for lunch with friends yesterday. The friends told me the food was really good, and I will agree that it was. Also good to note, I was very pleased that the staff all wore masks (even when serving outdoors), since it's not all that common everywhere. I ordered the chorizo panini which was flavorful with a nice crisp on the bread. Everything my friends ordered looked wonderful too and they loved the flavor. Other notables for people to know: they had outdoor seating. Real outdoor seating. The top was covered with a tent, but there was an open end and slats to the fencing so air could move around. Plenty of places say ""outdoor dining"" but then serve in an enclosed tent, which is not at all outdoor dining. The heaters above worked really well. I didn't feel the chill at all, and even took off my jacket for the meal. Bathrooms were also clean and well maintained, which is another bonus. I would definitely recommend to others.",Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd

I wish we had discovered it sooner- the food was so fresh and the prices are incredibly reasonable. Antonio, our server, made us feel so welcome and gave us great recommendations.

Will definitely visit again and recommend to anyone!",Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd
59191,69,264,Italian,5,05/26/2022,First time visit. The food was outstanding. Really unique choices. Unusual preparations and flavors. I could eat that beet salad for every meal! Small and cozy.

The staff is really friendly and the chef may be one of the most personable and passionate chefs I’ve ever met. He came out and spoke to my husband and me for a good 20 min about his love of cooking and his family. He also sent out dessert on the house!

59195,73,264,Italian,5,05/26/2021,Love love love this place.  Boyfriend and I chose it based on menu and reviews.  It’s byob so we stopped at the local liquor store... this is not a great neighborhood. We were having second thoughts.  Based on the neighborhood.  Don’t let that keep you away! We’ve been raving about this place.  We’re out of town era going back this weekend. Im almost afraid to leave a great review because space is limited.  We shared the mussels.  If you like mussels it’s a must try.  I’ve never had them in a creamy Alfredo type sauce before.   They were great! We had the white pie but added prosciutto. Really really great! They have a brick oven which makes a huge difference.  I have to mention the staff.  They went above and beyond.  Just can’t say enough,Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd

The Food is Absolutely Amazing!!!  The Atmosphere was Cozy  The Service Impeccable    The Chef came to great us at the table so I was able to share my appreciation of his Culinary Skills :)    I will most definitely be back....again and again!!",Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd

59198,76,264,Italian,2,05/26/2020,"If you are hoping for a leisurely Friday night dinner where you can catch up with a friend, this is not the place to go. We had a 6:00 reservation. The place is super tiny and was full.  About an hour into our meal, people started approaching our table and clearly rushing us. Within an hour and half, three servers and the owner had come over to ask us if we were done yet. We could not even enjoy the food nor each other's company. The meal was just average and came out a little cold. Besides that, it is my opinion that the wait staff is not very experienced nor  knowledgeable about the food. The substitutions, such as whole wheat pasta, were not even available. All in all, the experience for us was not pleasant. It is a busy place and the people working there do not know how to handle that. There is nothing that would make me want to return.",Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd
59199,77,264,Italian,5,05/26/2021,A very unassuming place. Has a seasonal menu with a number of interesting options as well as standard fare.

59201,79,264,Italian,5,05/26/2022,"Have wanted to try this place since the star ledger said it was one of ten new restaurants to try.  Covid put a damper on that.  From the outside it doesn't look like much, don't let that fool you.  The inside is quaint but they have sufficient outside tables that are shielded well from the traffic on Terrell road.  Staff is friendly, professional,  concerned you are pleased.  I enjoyed the grilled shrimp and mushroom crepe, the mussels were also excellent.  We ordered three entrees,  the snapper special, salmon, and filet mignon.   Presentation anflavors were outstanding.  We did not try a dessert but next time.  This is a do not miss restaurant.",Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd

59203,81,264,Italian,5,09/28/2022,"Went there tonight,  our friend invited us for dinner, and our experience was amazing,  food was excellent,  way more than we were expecting,  I highly recommend to anyone to try Jessica's cafe!!",Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd
59204,82,264,Italian,5,05/26/2020,"Jessica's Cafe is our latest great-find! The food is simply amazing: stuffed rice balls were wonderful! The wild mushroom and crabmeat crepe was to-die-for (I mean for real), and the meatball ricotta pizza was hands-down among the best pizza in this area. The pizzas easily serves two and we still took home leftovers.    The portions are generous, and we were stuffed. We'll be headed back soon for dinner and to try what seem like heavenly desserts!    A must-try cafe with friendly, attentive staff. So happy we've got new place with a fresh and varied menu! ",Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd
59205,83,264,Italian,5,05/26/2021,"I initially ordered take out and was unpleased and called to reconcile it. Normally I wouldn't call and complain, I'd just take it as a loss, but at $30 I was pretty disappointed at a very oily pasta. The way the manager and owner handled my complaint was nothing short of inspiring. To be brief the manager insisted I come back and re try the dish but I opted for other food items around the same price.    Spaghetti and Meatballs: 4.5 stars. delicious classic, non fussy, large portion.    Salad: 5, wonderfully curated, delicious, appropriately portioned.    Margarita pizza: 3.5 stars. Just meh, I've had better, it was a bit bland.    Burrata pizza: 5 stars, delicious, reasonable portion.    Hearing the owner speak about his food reminded of why I love cooking and creating, and they way he handled my complaint showed genuine craftsmanship and service. I reviewed the food as such because it would be a disservice to not offer ways to improve if there is room for it. The conduct of the owner and manager will make this place a must visit for me as a long time Plainfield resident and earned the 5 star rating for me. I am looking forward to making my way through the menu at Jessica's and being delighted by more of the inspiring dishes offered. A huge thank you again to Jessica's Cafe.",Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd
59206,84,264,Italian,3,05/26/2020,"Food is well priced and quality was ok, but there are better places in the area. Seemed like they wanted us in and out. Never saw specials for evening or offered dessert, just the check - will attribute entirely to the waitress/host that was there. Update, owner called and offered to come back which was impressive. Will be back for another meal.",Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd
59207,85,264,Italian,5,05/26/2021,"It doesn’t happen often at all, but I was just absolutely blown away by everything we ordered, especially by takeout. I mean, beyond impressed.

But best of all the food is absolutely distinctively delicious. We had the meatballs, mussels, and portobello and short rib panini. We wanted desert but we were too full. The staff is friendly and smiling and the restaurant makes you feel like you're at home. We're eager to return and experience other food on the menu.",Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd
59210,88,264,Italian,5,05/26/2022,"Best Gourmet Pizza in NJ!  This is not your local pizzeria by the slice or where you buy 10 pies for your super bowl party.  This is a fine Italian restaurant with a big, city taste in the middle of the burbs.  A True GEM.  The Pizza are filled with high quality ingredients blended with a savy sauce and the classic pull-melted cheese as you bite into the burnt-aroma slice from the wood-fire flame!!!  My favorite Pizza are the hot soppresata and the foie Gras (duck/goose liver) with wild mushrooms and truffle oil.  And when I'm not in the mood for Pizza, the entrees are just as elite.  The dishes ranges from salmon with black rice and smoke bacon to porterhouse cooked in a red wine mushroom sauce to overnight braised short-ribs.  My favorite appetizers are the RiceBalls!, wood-fired meatballs and the shrimp & mushroom crepe.  And for the desserts the apricot bread pudding is crack; I crave that alone at least twice a month.  Also you can't go wrong with the chocolate molten cake, creme brulee, and banana split with the homemade ice cream. They are All Legit!  And sometimes they have tiramasu, ask if they have it.  The Chef is a real cool, down to earth guy too. His name is Armen and has this authentic European accent that for some reason made me appreciate the food even more!  He walks around to check in on the customers.  This is a restaurant that I definitely look forward to at the end of the week, especially after a long week.  Moreover, a fine food establishment without having to dress fancy.  It's a casual-cozy restaurant but still nice enough to bring a date or your in-laws, especially on nights when they have a violinist.  Finally, what sets this place apart and makes it the Best...B! Y! O! B!!!!   Win!  Win!  WIN!!!",Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd
59211,89,264,Italian,5,05/26/2020,"Very good! Mushroom soup with a few croutons, good! Special: duck with lentils on cauliflower puree, pricey but worth every penny.

For Jessica's Cafe, the answer is yes!",Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd
59212,90,264,Italian,5,05/26/2020,"Absolutely awesome. This is not the food and service you would expect from this location. Friends told us about it and it is just incredible. We travel around the world and enjoy some of the best tables. Jessica's Cafe is up there. Fresh ingredients, really innovatively prepared and dishes come together as you would expect in NYC or Paris. Portions are ginormous so don't over order. It's a BYOB so you might have one of your best dinners ever, drinking one of your favorite bottle. Don't be fooled by the Plainfield address. A pearl in the oyster.",Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd
59213,91,264,Italian,5,05/26/2020,"Great diner and great service. I had the Pappardelle which was delicious and a big portion. My bride had the roasted veggie pizza, which was wonderful.

59214,92,264,Italian,5,05/26/2020,Stopped in last night and was quickly charmed with how cute and scenic the place was. Very cozy !! The food was amazing. I'm super picky with pizza (not as big of a pizza fan as the rest of the world lol) and this pizza was beyond good. We just got a plain pie but the basil and cheese were such a great combination of tastes. The portobello panini was also amazing but the best thing of the night was that apricot bread pudding  literally one of the best desserts I've ever had. Completely melts in the mouth and the sauce was so blissful  definitely will be going back!!! So happy with this place.,Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd
59215,93,264,Italian,5,05/26/2020,Every single thing I have ever ordered here has been perfection.

59217,95,264,Italian,5,05/26/2020,"What a gem! Excellent food. Great people. BYOB. Perfect assortment of dishes really well done. It's our go to and we'll bring friends! They are booked up so plan ahead or go early. The dining room is small so limited seating maybe 30 tables for 2(?) door a tad drafty. What did we have? We wanted to try thrice what we did! Mussels - bowl-licking good (blg). Wild Mushroom soup - blg (we used the bread to clean the bowl). Pizza with a most amazing tasty crust, with buratta and arugula and prosciutto (having leftovers this morning!). And a delicious pea and shrimp risotto, perfectly creamy, generous shrimp portion (also for this morning's breakfast). What would I change? A hint less salt because the ingredients also have salt. But it's not stopping us from going back! I hear the Pana Cotta is wonderful. Thank you to the Chef for sharing some of his story. Looking forward to learning more. Wishing you much success!",Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd
59218,96,264,Italian,5,05/26/2021,"We have had dinner at Jessica’s cafe on a number of occasions and brought friends there as well. We have always experienced wonderful food and friendly, enjoyable ambiance. My personal favorites are the amazing stuffed rice balls to share and the Papperdelle with braised short ribs (yumm). My partner loves the rigatoni. The crab and mushroom crepe is another favorite. The crepe is so delicate and the flavors blend brilliantly. I could go on for hours, but, you need to experience the amazing food designed and prepared by the Chef/Owner: Armal and his wonderful staff. Located on Terrill Road in Plainfield, he offers outdoor dining under a tent. Do try Jessica’s Cafe.",Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd

Our favorites are rice balls, mussels appetizers and Rigatoni Bolognese (best ever).  The owner is a really nice person and will do everything possible to make sure you have a good experience.  The one or two bad reviews on here are not justified.  I personally witnessed the most recent 1 star review and the resteraunt was slammed.  The customer claim of waiting 10 minutes is not valid.  The owner felt bad they left.  It's a shame that they didnt give their palletes an opportunity to taste his wonderful Italian delicacies.  Their loss.",Jessica's Cafe & Restaurant,150 Terrill Rd

Jessica's continues to be our ""go to"" place when we want (and know we'll receive) a FANTASTIC meal.  Sorry I'm not directing you to any specific dish as they are ALL amazingly good and we haven't had a dish that was less than ""write home about"" delicious.  Ok, here's a little suggestion.  If you like mushrooms and you see a mushroom dish that looks interesting, GET IT.  You can thank me later.  :-)    Also, this is BYOB.  If you are a wine drinker, bring your GOOD wine.

We were seated at a table and were left alone, no water, no service for 10 min. When servers were walking around, clearly saw us sitting there & the woman who sat us, saw us sitting there not being helped. My husband and I proceed to walk out because we waited a few more minutes and no one came to us and they watched us walk out and didn’t say a word.

The crust is chewy yet crunchy,  its thin but holds up to the unbelievable delicious, high quality tomatoes, fresh mozzarella  cheese, and my case hot soppressata ham and hot peppers. This is not your local pizza shop serving slices of Neapolitan pizza. This is a more rustic, home style, Old World pizza. Easily the closest you will get to Italy in the Great State of New Jersey.

The wait staff are kind and nothing is too much trouble. It's a neighborhood pizza place on one side and a beautiful and cozy restaurant on the other. That's the side we're on. The menu has something for every taste. Also parking is convenient on the surrounding streets.  All I can say is yum! Try it, you'll like it!",Cafe Milano Pizzeria and Restaurant,401 Forest Ave
60562,20,273,Italian,5,05/27/2018,"Never had a bad experience here. While reservations are not necessary, I would recommend making one during busy times, because the place can fill up pretty quickly, especially with large groups. Parking can be a pain, but it's NYC, so really if you expect easy parking, you need to reevaluate your expectations.

60568,26,273,Italian,4,05/27/2019,"For me, I judge a pizza place on 2 criteria foods; their plain pizza and their Buffalo Chicken pizza. I usually order one of each but after seeing the Buffalo slice I had to stick with that one alone. Well seasoned chicken smothered on top of a light, crispy, thick, deep dish/Sicilian style crust. Mozzarella cheese on top, and in my opinion not nearly enough. No bleu cheese dressing on it either, much to my dismay.    With that said, I have to say I really had no complaints. A good amount of heat that almost brought me to a sweat but very much with the necessary flavor in the heat to make it worthwhile. Eating this monstrous 1 slice was hard; the chicken was piled high and wide, with pieces continually falling onto me. BIB REQUIRED! The overall volume of food was a challenge in and of itself.    If you find yourself in the area, I reccomend you come in and enjoy a slice of this. You won't be disappointed.",Cafe Milano Pizzeria and Restaurant,401 Forest Ave
60569,27,273,Italian,1,05/27/2017,Second time our order was screwed up. First time we requested fresh mushrooms through their online web ordering service and paid extra and we got canned mushrooms. The second time we ordered sauce on the side for the calzone and it didn't come with it. We also ordered two burgers with cheddar that we had to pay $1.00 extra per burger. They called to say they didn't have cheddar but we didn't get our credit back for the more expensive cheese. When we called they told us they couldn't give us our money back but let them know the next time we order that we have a credit. They said he sauce was coming for our calzone but half an hour later when we called to ask where it was they said oh we are sending it now!!! They tried to blame their software for the problems and our solution was to get a new software program. Will not be ordering again from them!!!!!,Cafe Milano Pizzeria and Restaurant,401 Forest Ave

60571,29,273,Italian,4,05/27/2019,"Typical Italian fare. Nothing special about it but not much bad either. The prices jump if you decide to dine in which is a big turn off, you don't usually see a difference between dine-in and take-out prices which is probably why the dining room is always empty.    A minor issue: They nickle and dime you on beverages. A small glass of soda is 2.75, which isn't the worst I've seen but seltzer is the same price. And seltzer is usually gratis in restaurants.    The staff is friendly and attentive. This is how they earned their 4th star. My father in law has dementia. But the staff understands and is super kind. They bring him whatever he needs and we are extremely grateful.",Cafe Milano Pizzeria and Restaurant,401 Forest Ave

Heard great things about the place (I live right near Primo the other restaurant) It was DELICIOUS!! Every aspect was perfect: service, no waiting on a Saturday night was a score due to this open and spacious layout, and of course the food was exceptional! Going back soon.",Cafe Milano Pizzeria and Restaurant,401 Forest Ave
60575,33,273,Italian,2,05/27/2019,"Walked in for lunch at 2pm on a Sunday...there were no other people dining in and it took a minute or two for someone to realize we had walked in.  They sat us at the far wall...on the only table with a clearly rusted knife on it!  That still didn't deter us from ordering calamari, chicken alfredo and a cheese personal pie, but it should have! Calamari was ok but rubbery, thankfully didn't get sick but I would not test my luck again. Cheese pie was as good as usual (I previously only came for pick up, pizza was also ~$8 to dine in instead of $6), pasta was okay but nothing to rave about. The waitress did not refill our waters once the entire meal! The man who bussed our table refilled them as we were paying and leaving.

60577,35,273,Italian,1,05/27/2019,I dont understand how a place operates like this. We sent the eggplant parm back because it lacked taste and was not good and the owner said the best he can do is charge is half price for it and justify his decision by telling us we are the only customers to ever say that! Very unprofessional and why charge 18% gratuity for two people?,Cafe Milano Pizzeria and Restaurant,401 Forest Ave
60578,37,273,Italian,4,05/27/2019,"Probably the best pizza place in this area, many slices to choose from; pan and thin crust.

60580,39,273,Italian,4,05/27/2019,Excellent lunch menu. Portions very large.  They also have a nice optional lunch buffet for $9.95.

60586,45,273,Italian,3,05/28/2013,"Pizza is not bad, but we can't figure out why a pizza with no cheese should be more expensive than a regular pizza. We frequently order pizzas from a few different neighborhood places  and this is the only place where we pay more for less.

62024,19,283,Italian,4,05/27/2018,"The food is excellent here. Drinks are reasonably priced. However, it tends to get crowded on the weekends, and even with a reservation, you may get seated in a less than ideal spot.",Piccolino Restaurant NY,3935 Amboy Rd
62025,20,283,Italian,5,08/29/2022,"This place is a hidden gem! It’s tucked away in a strip mall and sign is hidden by outdoor structure, so unless you know it’s there it’s hard to spot. However, food is on point with large portions and very reasonable prices and service is outstanding. Go give them your business - you won’t regret it!",Piccolino Restaurant NY,3935 Amboy Rd
62026,21,283,Italian,5,05/26/2022,"I have been enjoying this restaurant for years. The service is top notch. The owner Alex goes above and beyond to treat each customer with the utmost respect. I have never had a bad meal here ever! The drinks are amazing and Alex himself will stuff  Blue cheese olives for our martinis.

62027,22,283,Italian,5,07/30/2022,Food is always delicious. Had cannoli for desert delicious. Staff is always friendly and accommodating. Nice atmosphere. Prices are reasonable. The veal marsala is so tender and just melts in your mouth like butter. There hush puppies are a must have.

62033,28,283,Italian,5,05/26/2022,"Never disappointed - food is quality and consistently delicious. I especially love the fried custard nuggets they serve with meals! Just to add, I recently ordered a $25 pre-fixe dinner for delivery and was told they only do $50 minimum for deliveries - really??? I guess they're not hurting as much as they say, so I cancelled my order and went with another restaurant.",Piccolino Restaurant NY,3935 Amboy Rd

62035,30,283,Italian,3,05/26/2022,"Was good,  service was slower we were accustomed to. Sweet n sour calimari with hot red peppers was delicious (highly recommend) ... but forever to get our main course. ... and the meal wasn't exceptional .... sadly 2 of the 4 of us got sick afterwards, stomach. Realized the fried custard puffs may have been the cause (the 2 were the only ones who ate them)    Will go back, have eaten there numerous times without issues, but this was a first.  (Please note ,parties of 6 or 8, a 20% is added onto the bill and the servers dont tell you that ... table behind us didnt realize until someone saw it on the bill ...)",Piccolino Restaurant NY,3935 Amboy Rd

62039,34,283,Italian,1,05/26/2022,"Unfortunately never got to eat here because when we came in this weekend there was no one inside to seat us. After looking around for few mins a guy on his phone comes in says sit anywhere. Another 5-10 mins pass, no menu, no one around. He is still walking around outside on his phone. So we left. It’s d this is how you treat customers you will very soon be closed.",Piccolino Restaurant NY,3935 Amboy Rd
62040,35,283,Italian,4,05/27/2018,It was really busy on a Saturday night.  Our pasta dishes came out dry!  They had been sitting under the heat lamps to to long.  That was a MAJOR disappointment because we were out celebrating my birthday.  We should have sent it back. The other dishes were great and freshly cooked.  The staff is great and experienced.  Desserts were disappointing.  Nice entertainment. My husband had been there previously and raved about it.  We'll have to give it another try when the place is less stressed out.,Piccolino Restaurant NY,3935 Amboy Rd
62041,36,283,Italian,5,05/26/2021,Charming restuarant in the back areas of Staten Island....went there after a tour. Outstanding service and food. Be prepared to wait a little while for your perfect dish during prime time dinning hours on a Saturday.,Piccolino Restaurant NY,3935 Amboy Rd
62042,37,283,Italian,2,05/26/2021,"One of the worst places I have ever been. Food is not testy at all. Desert was kind of ok, but the rest of the stuff is terrible. It took very long time for my order to be prepared even though only two tables were occupied. The waitress, not supposed to work as a waitress, he is slow, forgets stuff and you wait fir him forever. I was waiting for my credit card to be back for 15 minutes and what happened, this waitress forgot about it even though he saw us sitting all packed and strangely looking at him. This is the first and last time I go to that spot.",Piccolino Restaurant NY,3935 Amboy Rd

62045,40,283,Italian,3,05/26/2022,Foods good but for the prices they charge portions especially pasta dishes are way too small . Pasta even fresh is about the cheapest food item to serve so why not fill the patrons dish with it .,Piccolino Restaurant NY,3935 Amboy Rd
62046,41,283,Italian,4,05/26/2021,Love this restaurant!!!  Food and service are always excellent!!!  I know it may be silly but my only complaint is they only have 1 bathroom for men and 1 for woman and the lines get long which interrupts the dining experience.,Piccolino Restaurant NY,3935 Amboy Rd

62048,43,283,Italian,3,05/27/2018,The food at this Italian Restaurant is delicious. The child menu is limited and let me to believe children aren't as accommodated to. I went in for lunch whilr the restaurant was still quiet and the staff was not entirely friendly until other patrons came in then the service picked up. As the only patron there with my children i should have been served first and expeditiously but was not.  Over all the staff did pick up the pace and hospitality.,Piccolino Restaurant NY,3935 Amboy Rd

62053,49,283,Italian,5,05/26/2020,"Food and service were excellent. I had pasta melanzana, chicken marsala. The only issue was the price of wine, they just double the retail price so a bottle of Santa Margarita Pinot Grigio was $58",Piccolino Restaurant NY,3935 Amboy Rd

CALLED NO ANSWER..HOW DO YOU RUN A BUSINESS LIKE THIS AND STAY IN BUSINESS? HOW MUCH MONEY DID YOU LOOSE BY NOT BEING OPEN ON TIME?

62063,59,283,Italian,3,05/27/2018,"Good food, TERRIBLE SERVICE. Not the fault of the wait staff but they were terribly understaffed. The waiter seemed to also be the host and the maitre'd. The net effect was that we were kept waiting for 15 minutes even though we had reservations AND the bartender was inattentive because he was so busy. Too bad, good food, nice decor, but service killed the experience.",Piccolino Restaurant NY,3935 Amboy Rd

62065,61,283,Italian,1,05/27/2019,Terrible.  The staff can hardly speak english and they charged me $10 for one glass of house wine.  If it wasn't house wine and more upscale they didn't inform me.
