0,0,0,Chinese,4,06/23/2022,"Good canto-style Sichuan food — meaning, not too spicy or salty. Less catered towards modern Chinese tastes, but nonetheless very tasty. Prices are what you would normally expect for New York. Execution of food is good. Service is courteous and friendly.",The Best Sichuan,47 W 39th St
1,1,0,Chinese,4,10/21/2022,I ordered hot pot chicken and honestly it was delicious! It was reasonably priced at $20. (Most dishes here are in the $25 to $40 range here.). The spice level was med high and just perfect. Rice is not free but rath $1.  Service was great as well!,The Best Sichuan,47 W 39th St
2,2,0,Chinese,4,05/19/2022,"New Sichuan restaurant in an area that already has many good sichuan options can be tricky, especially with a name that might seem like a tall  claim…but The Best Sichuan do live up to it. Excellent authentic szechuan food, nice service. Good value for money. The ambiance was pretty nice and cozy. The staff were very kind and hospitable. We had a great time. Highly recommend this place!",The Best Sichuan,47 W 39th St
3,3,0,Chinese,5,06/23/2022,I am always down for sichuan food especially with friend. You get to order many dishes and try them all. Family style dining is the way to go guys.    Called for a reservation but you don’t need to for a Friday night. It’s barely half filled and that should change after this awesome review of course. The place can use some touch up especially when entering. It looks a little chaotic and your eye will gravitate to the second floor balcony dining area. Next time I want that spot.    We skip directly to the entree. Appetizers are for people who are not hungry and none of us fit into that category. Omg the food. Chili pepper fish fillet is out of this world. Just the pepper corn is a little messy to eat. I wish they would just grind it down to powder. Double cook pork is on par and rest of the dinner.    The service lady is nice with very very little English. We managed to get our order correctly thou.    Thanks for the lemon in the water that is a great touch.,The Best Sichuan,47 W 39th St

11,11,0,Chinese,5,01/19/2023,They are not messing around with spice!  My wife is usually underwhelmed with a 5 star level spice dish but tonight she met her match!  The king pao chicken that I ordered was just right.  The food and service was just fantastic and I'm sorry that we were headed to a show and couldn't bring the leftovers.  The portion sizes for dinner are easily enough for 2-3 people.,The Best Sichuan,47 W 39th St
12,12,0,Chinese,5,09/21/2022,"I’ve gone to The Best Sichuan for years and it is one of the best chinese as well as sichuan restaurants in NYC.    Before they relocated to 39thST a few years ago and hit the pandemic, they used to be on 38thST between 6th and Broadway. The restaurant was always full of customers and well-known for great sichuan food in the area.    This current location is even better as it has more upscale looking with high ceiling and a beautiful bar. They carry all kinds of liquors with reasonable price.    If you are not so familiar with sichuan cuisine(generally spicy) , you could go with their delicious and authentic fresh made dumplings. Also, their fried rice is not so greasy but really flavorful. My personal favorite is dry pepper style chicken. If you like spicy peppery stir fried chicken, this is something you would have to try. Also, the dry pot style is amazing as the meat is so tender and flavorful with all different veggies in the pot and it is served with small stove on your table and keep the food warm until you are done. It is highly recommended as well.    In terms of service, they provide customers with best service. The food and drinks come always fast. All the waitstaffs are so nice and attentive, and especially the head waiter is very kind! They have a lot of regular customers visiting frequently from the area as the service is amazing. It is truly hard to find a place like The Best Sichuan that serve great quality food with reasonable price and great service. Highly highly recommend here!!!",The Best Sichuan,47 W 39th St
13,13,0,Chinese,5,06/23/2022,I was wanting Chinese food and found this place on Google and am really happy that I chose to go in. The inside is gorgeous and the staff was very accommodating.

Would definitely come back again.,The Best Sichuan,47 W 39th St

We came at about 6:30 on a Sunday and it was almost completely empty, so no wait. The staff are very friendly and professional; our server was attentive and the food was amazing!

15,15,0,Chinese,5,11/20/2022,"My partner and I got Chicken fried rice and general Tao’s to share. The portions were perfect and the food was AMAZING. BF said it was some of the best food he’s ever had. Staff is super attentive and from order to our food coming out was a total of 4 minutes. Came after a Broadway show and it was a super quick walk and got seated right away(we did eat @4pm so a bit early). BF made sure to eat every pieces of rice on the plate.

22,22,0,Chinese,4,05/20/2019,Really delicious food. Stick to the Sichuan specialties. The soup dumplings are not great. But the everything with a Sichuan pepper in it is.

23,23,0,Chinese,3,05/20/2019,"Came with relatives while visiting on a trip. We stayed at the hotel next door, and they were just looking for the nearest Chinese restaurant.

24,24,0,Chinese,5,05/19/2020,"Not greasy. Very flavorful.    I am particular about my sichuan order and they delivered on their promise. No msg, no seasoning beyond the sichuan peppercorns while keeping it to low sodium.    I ordered several beef and beef tendon appetizers. It was a very nice experience.    For my children, I needed it to be non-spicy and they made it very nice. Ingredients were fresh including the rice was soft!",The Best Sichuan,47 W 39th St

27,27,0,Chinese,3,05/20/2019,Unimpressed perhaps because I'm not familiar with authentic Sichuan cuisine but the flavors weren't tasty to me. The simple vegetable spring roll was... off.  The atmosphere is decent with gold and red throughout the dining area and simple place settings on a  paper table covering.  The menu had a few typos but was helpful as it provided pictures for most of the dishes. I was pleased that the heat levels could be adjusted for any dish.  The staff was eager and pleasant.  The B grade was a bit of a concern but I didn't find any major flaws in the cleanliness/appearance. I did however notice white particles lingering at the bottom of my glass of water (this could have been from lemon though).,The Best Sichuan,47 W 39th St

We ordered the beef noodle soup, scallion pancakes, shredded potato, and Fu ji fei pian (seasoned cold beef slices) and they each tasted amazing.

71,71,0,Chinese,5,05/19/2022,"A delicious spot for Sichuan on a street that's already rich with Sichuan pleasures. Nothing we had was all that spicy (not even with 3 pepper symbols), but everything was balanced, well prepared and full of flavor. The wontons in chili oil were in a sauce so yummy I would have taken some home with me - garlicy, deeply savory and vinegared with just a hint of chili. The whole braised fish was especially awesome, dry fried in cumin with great skill and then plunged into a chili bath with loads of good veg and glass noodles. One really could just order this and be happy. The mapo tofu had me worried because it looked a little gloppy, but the flavor was great there too. Personally I wish they would turn up the spice just a little bit (it would sell me more beer), but the flavors were excellent, so I can't fault it. Covid seems to have left them with a sadly empty dining room, when clearly they deserve better, so if you're concerned that there is no one inside, worry not - it's good.

From what I understand, this is still not traditional, but it was very good. The waiter took our order and met all requests. A Chinese client took us and it sounded like they were very accommodating about any requests. The service after that was a bit lacking and I think my water glass had soap in it, but that didn't subtract from the food enough to give a lower rating. Plenty of seating and seemed well staff.

We said we didn't want it.  Got some dumplings instead.  Then we get this sad story about how the owner makes the waiter pay for food that is sent back.  That sucks, but the beef doesn't taste good.    We get the bill and it's wrong.  Then, as far as can tell they scam the ticket to make it look like we ate the beef so he wouldn't get charged.  But then finally, I realized that they charged me a 20% tip.  Which considering the fact that we had to ask for our drinks twice and that the waiter had to be metaphorically dragged away after we said we didn't like the beef, is not what I would have given him.

The fish was not authentic Szechuan fish at all. The Bok Choy dish has sand in it and it is likely they did not wash the Bok Choy at all. The rice is pretty much what you can get from the cheapest Chinese takeout place.    The waiter said we get 10% discount if we pay by cash. I agreed only to find out I am forced to pay more than 20% tips because the tips was included from the initial check already. I was in a rush so I didn’t check carefully.

Could not eat without fear of food poisoning. Had to leave still very hungry.

Although cash only (reminder for ya,) prices were fairly enough! Not expensive. We had 5 ppl, 5 dishes, about $22 each, FYI.    The way they cooked the crab was amazing! The sauce was made with grounded pork and egg. It tasted so good when you bite in the crab.    The pickled cabbage fried with squid was another unique dish that I’ll totally recommend. Same, they did well when making flavors.    The fried rib was the same. It looked plain but salty enough! Not that oily too.    And green was for healthy but necessary!",Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St
663,1,2,Chinese,4,01/19/2023,"We just found this restaurant on Friday night in a hurry, and the overall experience was okay. It had an interesting vibe downstairs the building, an old China town experience. We had fried rice, pepper stuffed shrimps, and lemon chicken with two beers and paid around 80 bucks, which was quite expensive considering that it was China town and was cash-only. The pepper shrimp can be quite spicy even as an Asian person who is strong with spicy food, but very addictive, and I’d also recommend lemon chicken if you like something sweet, but fried rice was not so impressive.",Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St
664,2,2,Chinese,2,07/23/2022,"Hop Kee was recommended as a place to get authentic fried rice because everyone else is serving yellow rice as fried rice. The food was okay.  The fried rice fail to tantalize my taste buds.  Nonetheless, there are old fashioned in that it’s cash only.  My quest for decent china food goes on",Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St
665,3,2,Chinese,3,07/23/2022,"Heard great things about this restaurant and had many celebrity endorsements.  Located in Chinatown, it has quite an authentic look and feel. Nothing modern about this restaurant.  The food was decent but they brought us the wrong item. Must try the egg roll, only because it had such a unique taste.",Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St
666,4,2,Chinese,4,09/21/2022,"Chinatown is my favorite area to eat in NYC. I love to get a small item from several different places.    On our last trip to NYC, my husband and I stopped here and got Salted Pork Chop with Hot Pepper and took it to go since we prefer not to eat inside (there is no outdoor seating). The dish was delicious!    They're cash only which needs a bit of advanced warning since it's a full sit down restaurant where you're going to spend a decent amount of money. Make sure you have enough cash on you.",Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St
667,5,2,Chinese,5,12/20/2022,"Ate with a large group here and the experience was top notch. The food was delicious!    I was surprised when the server said no to a few items on our order but they ended up being so right, we couldn’t have eaten any more if we tried!",Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St
668,6,2,Chinese,2,06/23/2022,"Personally, I think the taste, service and environment of this restaurant are very general. It is difficult to recommend it. Ordered two dishes, a fried paste crab and a fried sub chicken. The crab  is obviously not fresh, even in frozen products is not good. The meat is loose, soft cotton, a little seafood taste of no. Very not recommended to order.  fried chicken is also not good, not juicy and very dry. Lastly to the service : the attitude is very general, not yet finished eating the bill anxiously brought to let pay. The cups are not clean, there are foreign objects inside . Finally, the tip is also the default 18%, not to give the choice at all. In short, I have eaten so much Chinese food in the United States, but the overall situation is really bad. Even if it has been open for more years, it should be customer first, but I feel that this restaurant is spoiled.",Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St
669,7,2,Chinese,4,05/12/2023,"We love going to Hop Lee (just across the street), but when they are closed we hop over to Hop Kee. They have a massive menu with you favorite southern chinese dishes. The hot and sour soup is great, as is the fried squid dish. The vegetable dishes usually have fresh veggies, adding to the flavor. It can be hard to get attention of the staff, and the ambience is ""we are affordable.""",Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St

672,10,2,Chinese,3,03/20/2023,Went here on the suggestion of a friend. The food was pretty good but the service was not. I told the person I am open to try any non vegetarian dish with sauce and I like spicy food and he suggested a dish without sauce and only salt and little pepper. The dish was tasty but I would have preferred something with sauce and a bit spicy for my pallet.,Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St
673,11,2,Chinese,3,05/19/2022,"I did not like the lobster and the crabs. Heavy , too much sauce and the lobster had a ""fishy"" smell. The wonton soup and the fried flounder were good,  so it was the vegetarian moshu. I saw more inviting dishes being served, their I may give it another try. Cash only. The place is very basic. Service is ok. It's in the basement of a building.",Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St
674,12,2,Chinese,1,08/22/2022,"This is my first time writing a review on Google because this place server so RUDE I never meet before. Because we find a bug in the crab and ask the one of server,he did not feel sorry and so rude to throw the crab to another bowl by his hand.We are so shocked for this behavior and he said  that’s not a problem. You just throw away the bug and you can still eat it. I feel he is so angry about my complaints because he said this bug is not from crabs, just fly into it, it doesn’t matter. But I think wherever then bug is from, that would be not good experience for me ,right? Why he not feel sorry and feel that normally.  Anyway, if you guys still wanna go this place，please notice that do not choose the server who are bald and little be fat. other servers should be fine,at least,they were attitude was better than that one.",Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St

676,14,2,Chinese,3,05/19/2022,"This is a very well known establishment within Chinatown and has the celebrity visitors to prove it. It is quite small and cozy, as are most restaurants in Chinatown, so be prepared to wait on a busy day. The food lives up to its reputation. However, if you do not order as much as they would prefer you to, be prepared to be pressured into ordering more dishes. When we stood our ground and insisted that we had ordered enough food, and it really was enough, we received rude remarks and non-existent service through the course of our meal. The food itself was delicious. The crab was wonderful and the fish was fresh. The egg drop dumpling soup was quite unique and delicious as was the fried squid dish. If it were not for the poor service, this would have easily been nearly five stars.",Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St
677,15,2,Chinese,5,12/20/2022,A great underground gem. Salt fried squid and pork fried rice were incredible. Very eager to return and try more of their offerings.

Note: Cash only and 18% tip is applied to bill,Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St
678,16,2,Chinese,4,12/20/2022,Hop Kee accommodated a large group for lunch recently. Food quality and taste was above average to excellent. Traditional no-nonsense/frills setting. Friendly staff.

681,19,2,Chinese,1,03/20/2023,I would not recommend this place to eat! Food wasn’t valued for the price; soup was not warm enough while food has no taste; noodles seemed like pre-cooked; other plates were salty and ingredients were poorly prepared. One of the least recommended place.  Please ensure not paying double tips; bill/check already included 18% tips.,Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St
682,20,2,Chinese,2,04/19/2023,"Service is just bad. One guy gets my vote for rudest waiter in Chinatown. Lots of male waiters sitting or standing around but we had to refill our own water. And to top that, they automatically add a 20% tip. The only saving grace is the Cantonese style crab. Save your cash. Go have Dim Sum at House of Joy.",Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St

The decor is a little bit dated for my taste but if your looking for a traditional Chinese restaurant feel, then this is the spot. Most of the workers pretty decent in the customer service department but nothing a good didnt fix. I didnt get to visit the menu as i wanted to but im definitely going to give this place a 2nd, 3rd and 4th visit.",Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St
684,22,2,Chinese,1,04/28/2023,"Beware of this restaurant! While the food are good and service was great, the check out was the worst! A 20% gratuity was already added into our tap when we paid but we couldn’t tell because there were no item descriptions. I felt like they did it discreetly and purposely for patrons who doesn’t know and tips on top of the added on.",Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St
685,23,2,Chinese,5,03/20/2023,It's a classic Cantonese restaurant geared towards American tastes. The food I've had there is always excellent. I stop by as often as possible especially when I'm with out of town friends.,Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St

690,28,2,Chinese,5,05/20/2018,One of the best authentic Chinese food joint in Chinatown NYC. Bigger portion size that you can share with few friends or if you have a big appetite. Spicy fried pork was a hit but the crab dish was the best thing. You have to get your hands dirty to get the best of the crab. Duck friedrice and the spinach accompanied the dishes well.,Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St
691,29,2,Chinese,4,05/19/2020,"Amazing chinese cuisine in the middle of New York's China Town. It was suggested us by our friends who visited this restaurant a couple of months ago. We had crabs, flounder fish, jumbo shrimp and a couple of chicken dishes. The taste was amazing. The portion was apt as well. The only thing I did not like is that there was no option to pay by card. We had to pay by cash. The service was great although and the servers were very friendly. I would definitely suggest you try this place out but make sure you carry cash. :)",Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St
692,30,2,Chinese,4,05/20/2019,"Went for Christmas Day lunch. Was very packed (as expected) service was pretty quick. Portions a bit smaller than usual, maybe because of the holiday.

I would go back for it again and again.",Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St

695,33,2,Chinese,3,05/19/2020,"I guess the first criticism, would be the food. They serve in large portion which is good, but they seem to drench a lot of dishes in sauce. We ordered tofu vegetables, beef with vegetables, vegetable dumplings, two bowls of brown rice, and lastly seafood vegetables.    Second criticism is maybe the waiters were off around this moment, but it was hard to get their attention, and they forgot to write down the last order therefore it was never brought out and we had to split. That's no problem.    However when the check came, it was expensive. And the taste of the food was decent. They included a 16% tip and tax which came out to around almost $50. They accept cash and debit card. It was three of us, so if that last dish would have came out the bill would have been around $60.    Honestly for the price and service of the place, I don't think it was worth it. Also, a third person had commented the bathrooms were dirty.",Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St

703,41,2,Chinese,2,05/19/2022,Use to really like this place have not been here since COVID. I must say they really feel off the duck was a chopped up bones and the service was the worst of have ever seen and the attitude of the servers was horrific. Cash only and then they added an 18 percent gratuity without even saying and that is totally illegal. When I payed and ask the server for a my reciet for my records he caught such an attitude I wonder why.  Now I know why the place 2 stores down had a line outside and this place had about 5 tables.  Change your attitude and stop trying to rip off your customers.  You just lost another. Also tip should be added before the tax.,Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St
704,42,2,Chinese,4,12/20/2022,"I think the food in this restaurant are pretty good and authentic. I liked it. But the service and atmosphere were just minimal. A default 18% of tip isn’t fair, especially for lunch.",Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St

Based off of the reviews, we expected an above average experience, but unfortunately, it wasn’t the case for our first visit.    The ambience was nice, but the service and some of the foods could definitely be improved, and there were some hygiene concerns.  We were seated immediately and served free hot tea. When my husband poured it out into his tea cup, he found a dead cricket that fell onto the table. We pointed it out to the server surreptitiously, and he immediately apologized and came out with a new tea pot.    As for our meals, we ordered spicy pork, the chicken Hop Kee dish made of fried chicken strips mixed with vegetables, and a crab dish. The fried chicken strips were crunchy, yet full of fat and drenched in a tasteless brown sauce that added nothing and only made the chicken soggy. The crab dish was not bad, and the fried pork was the best out of the three, but still nothing spectacular.    Overall, however, we weren’t impressed because of the brusque service, mediocre and flavorless food for a highly rated restaurant (the food we ordered anyway), and a dead cricket.",Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St

Julienne sliced pork, scallion greens, fresh noodles, it looks great in the box!  The chicken and broccoli was very good. I love the way they slice the chicken breast, super tender with luscious gravy. I wish there was more gravy, though. Barbecued ribs are very healthy! All of the fat is trimmed away.

796,134,2,Chinese,3,05/20/2019,Not bad - ordered the crab with black bean sauce which I enjoyed. But the food felt like it wasn’t inspired. Which when combined with the gaulky wait staff and typical Chinatown decor left me less than mind blown.    The crab was actually really not bad. If they had some crackers to use - I’d probably have given the place 4 stars.,Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St

803,141,2,Chinese,4,05/20/2016,"Basically: sometimes you just want some hot greasy Chinese takeout but you still want to maintain some kind of Chinatown street cred - the subterranean Hop Kee (ouch, watch your head) is where it's at.    Longer version: Despite my terrible attempts at Canto, I was still able to score three excellent dishes (though it seems that everything on the menu is generally awesome): the steamed dumplings; half order of roasted duck; and beef with Chinese broccoli. But to be on the safe side, I would bring a Cantonese-speaking friend along, even though the waiters are generally on the friendlier side of Chinatown establishments. When we asked him whether he'd recommend the roast duck or the crispy duck under the Specials section, he suggested the half, and even cracked a smile at our question of how delicious it would be.    He wasn't kidding: that roast duck was absolutely bomb. Cut into thick slivers and topped with crispy skin and a chunk of delicious fat right underneath, the duck gave all the duck I ate in Beijing (clearly the gold standard for duck) a run for their money.    The Chinese broccoli was my next favorite, though if you're averse to garlic, probably don't order this, as the whole dish came studded with little bits of garlic.    Dumplings were definitely much bigger and doughier than your average takeout dumplings, but they didn't need the brown oyster sauce drizzled on top. A soy sauce/hot chili combo would have worked much better. Also, the crunchiness that another reviewer decried is simply chopped up water chestnuts (which, by the way, I've never seen tucked inside a dumpling).    All in all, two dishes and one appetizer were around $45. Hop Kee was massively crowded on a Saturday night, but the line moves very fast - the place has a bigger second room inside.",Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St
804,142,2,Chinese,5,05/21/2014,"This place is my favorite in the world. My family has been coming here for several generations. My grandfather would bring my whole family here, then my father did the same. The food is amazing, and authentic Cantonese. The service is always really good, and your orders come out very fast. I can't stress that enough. I don't think I've had to wait more than 10 minutes any time I've ordered a dish. Living in Jersey, every time I go to NYC I have to stop here to eat. They're open late, but not as late as they used to stay open. Definitely do prefer it to Wo Hop (who are good in their own right). I really recommend their Flounder Kow if you feel like spending the money. I've never been disappointed coming here once. I love Hope Kee",Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St

The honey walnut shrimp, which I order at just about every Chinese restaurant had probably the largest shrimp of any restaurant I've been to (and I've been to a ton) but the mayo sauce was too heavy and thick and the broccoli wasn't good.

Both times I had their Duck Chow Fun and both times the Duck THOUROUGHLY impressed me.    The service is okay, I have had two different experiences with my service--the latter experience being exceptional. The subpar experience was not enough for this place to lose a star in my review.

When they sat us, they practically threw our dinnerware on the table. Since they put a pot of tea on the table, we felt bad about just walking out so instead just decided to order one dish to share. The waiter gave us a weird look for only ordering one plate and mumbled something about a minimum and walked away. Since we didn’t hear what he said, we got up to ask him and he told us that there was a minimum charge of $9 per person and would charge us regardless, even though we only ordered one dish that cost about $16! There was no mention of this minimum charge on the menu or displayed anywhere around the restaurant. We walked out right then and there.

Along with many other Filipino-Americans, our parents have been bringing us here since we were children. This was always where we brought out-of-towners visiting NYC for the first time.

One weird factoid: they never seem to have anyone who speaks fluent English. It's Chinatown, so it's okay, but I'm like 40 now... Would've thought that might have changed...

848,188,2,Chinese,5,05/19/2020,"I love the place. Lo Mein is the best. Steak with Chinese Broccoli is a 10. Everything I've ever had has been great, and I'm coming here since the 70s if you can believe that!",Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St

But the food was not good us,especially the waiter was not kind.  The Price was $22, I put $3 on the table as a tip.  I could not give him over $3 thinking his rudeness.  When I put it on the table,the waiter said ""tip should be $4 or $5"".  He complained it loudly....the other customers heard it.  Oh my goodness, Nonsense!!!!!!!!  If  you dont give him 20~25% tip in spite of rudeness, you can hear the same  statement.",Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St
851,191,2,Chinese,1,05/20/2017,"Food was good... but wow the service. I was eating and some guy asked if they accepted a credit card and instead of politely saying no and suggesting he use the ATM right upstairs from the place, the server rudely states, ""no cash only, what do you do for a living that you have no cash?"" And then when we were leaving the server stops us and demands 3 more dollars for a tip, like what kind of establishment is this. Very dissatisfied with this place",Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St
852,192,2,Chinese,4,05/20/2019,"Now I know why this was Anthony Bourdain 's favorite Chinese restaurant.  We ordered the Hop Kee fried chicken which was served with a generous portion of bok choy, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts and other vegetables.  Chicken fried rice had generous portions of chicken and bean sprouts.   The Cantonese style lobster and beef with crispy noodles.   Everything was FANTASTIC!  The lobster sauce was absolutely delicious.  Service was efficient but could have been better.  The kitchen is quite inflexible if you want to change something.   All in all an extraordinary meal.",Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St
853,193,2,Chinese,3,05/21/2013,"Have been there a couple of times. Great food, good price. The place is not fancy or well decorated. The staff are OK, it seems as if they don't care much.

862,202,2,Chinese,4,05/20/2018,Craved for cantonese food today... So tried hop kee. The price compared with the other Chinese place is a little bit higher. The restaurant looks clean. I ordered beef chow fun to go. A lot of beef and tastes great. They also provide a Chinese and a English meun. Westerner might like come here to have authentic cantonese meal.,Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St

864,204,2,Chinese,4,05/21/2012,"If you recall watching an episode of No Reservations, you probably remember Anthony Bourdain eating here. Even before this episode was aired, I have known and dined at this place while growing up. Hop Kee is perhaps one of the few oldest Chinese restaurants there is in Chinatown. At Hop Kee, they serve some of the finest authentic (depends how you define authentic) Chinese cuisines, Canton style mainly, that always make people come back for more. Nowadays, the place is more catered to Westerners, so it’s typical to find those common dishes you would find at other Chinese restaurants like chicken and broccoli, or your pork fried rice. However, some of my favorite dishes remain to be the ones that I eat at home, like steamed flounder with black beans and soy sauce, or ginger-scallion lobsters, to list a few. The prices have definitely gone up, but Hop Kee remains a historical part of Chinatown bringing Canton cuisines to all taste.",Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St
866,206,2,Chinese,1,05/20/2019,"We went to this restaurant to check out what the hype was. It was underwhelming. The staff was rude, we felt unwelcome as we sat there. The food was bland. Definitely not going back. I've seen better restaurants than this.",Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St
867,208,2,Chinese,4,05/20/2016,"If you want a throwback to the early days of Chinese food Hop Kee is nostalgic yet puts out quality food. I’ll be honest that I’ve never had Chop Suey, Lomein or Egg Foo Young for the curious. Strangely it is also known for serving Filipino food like the oddly crab in a egg sauce. Why would you do that to a crab I’ll never know but each  their own I guess.    We decided to stick with the Cantonese dishes offered on the menu and to try the Chop Suey reminiscent of 1860’s Chinese American invention.  The portions are generous and food comes out quickly. The staff friendly by Chinese restaurant standards. To end the experience. Of course the mainstay a fortune cookie.",Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St
868,209,2,Chinese,5,05/20/2019,"Only reason I crawl into the Rotten Apple, to eat here. Favorite restaurant of all time. Anthony Bourdain ate here a few years back. Came to pay tribute and enjoy one of the last true Cantonese restaurants in Chinatown.",Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St
869,210,2,Chinese,2,05/20/2019,"As a Chinese person, I’m not sure where half of the dishes actually originated from...? I felt like... maybe this is food from some tiny small village in China where everything is doughy, overfried to a medium brown, and every dish tastes the same because maybe they had food scarcity?    This is definitely NOTHING close to the complexity Chinese cuisine can offer. The flavors here were all muted and cornstarchy. I felt like I was on a show for how many ways can you serve the same 3 ingredients. Just stick to the restaurant directly above hop kee called Shanghai Asian Manor. It’s not as low priced, but there’s a HUGE difference in quality.    Y’all just cuz it’s a hole in the wall doesn’t mean you found a gold gem. Sometimes it’s literally a hole. In the wall.",Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St

875,216,2,Chinese,3,05/19/2020,"Just OK.  I am disappointed that sauteed crab and other dishes are not as good as they used to be years ago.  About half of mussels were smelling stale.  Funny thing is, the place was busy, but my wife noticed that there weren't any Chinese customers.  Perhaps it is just a tourist place now.",Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St

896,237,2,Chinese,3,05/20/2016,"I come here all the time with my family, and I'm not sure why they prefer this place over Golden Unicorn, but I'm going to guess it's because it's a little cheaper here and there's usually no wait. Typical mediocre dimsum fare here, nothing spectacular or particularly amazing here. If you don't want to wait for your dimsum fix, and don't care for the ambiance, (table cloth are pretty dirty) then come here. If you want better dimsum, I suggest Golden Unicorn down the block, however there will most likely be a long wait there. The service here is not the best, and the last time I came it took forever to get chicken feet. We were sitting there for at least an hour, asking every cart that came by if they had chicken feet.

1163,514,2,Chinese,5,05/19/2020,"As someone who grew up in Beijing, I found this place serving very close to authentic Beijing cuisine.    There are lots of items on the menu that fall under Beijing cusine whereas some don't.    Ordered beef tripe with sesame paste - instant nostalgic taste. Try this if you like tahini.    Dessert tray: you have to order this! Beijing desserts and they taste very like originals!!! I miss home even looking at it.    Cabbage with mustard: this is another Beijing cuisine. It's very very spicy with hint of mustard. The spiciness isn't like Szechuan food but rather like you're chewing horseradish:)    Braise pork belly: I really like this one but it doesn't stand out compare to other Chinese restaurants.    Meatball - okay. They put eggs in the meatball which is interesting    Prime beef - this is not even Chinese cuisine. The meat tastes very tender however under seasoned.    House soup: more like Southern Chinese cuisine but it's very hearty    Overall I recommend this place and will probably visit again.    Note that: 1) they no longer have Peking roast duck 2) no reservations available. On Friday and weekends the wait is 30-45 min.    Update on 1/10/2023:  Revisit after they opened for a while. The wait is within 10min on weekday evenings but all people in your party have to be present in order to get seated.    Ordered braised whole fish with pancake. It's tasty and portion is okay but a little greasy. Not very authentic Beijing food but good enough. Service is still very accommodating and friendly.",Hop Kee Restaurant,21 Mott St

Most of time they say no. They only reason why I give this a 4 instead of a 5 is that if you are new to this place the waitors can be rude. Maybe blunt per say.

It's a popular restaurant located on Mott St., where many famous Chinese restaurants are located, but even after our visit in 2004, it has always been in the top 10 Chinese restaurants in NY, and it seems that the taste has not declined.    Nearby is Joe's Shanghai, which is well-known for its xiao long bao, but since I was with my junior high school daughter, I decided to have lunch here, which seems to be a popular and abundant menu.    It was my first time at this restaurant, so I ordered beef fried rice and my daughter ordered boiled dumplings.  When I was a university student, I ate beef fried rice in San Francisco's Chinatown.  My daughter didn't like boiled dumplings, so unfortunately I couldn't make a good memory for her.

It’s not what your think of fake Beijing duck place - but many traditional Beijing home cooking items in beautiful preparation.,Chai 柴院 | Authentic Chinese Restaurant,353 W 46th St
1425,1,4,Chinese,5,07/23/2022,"Very nice place for hangout with friends. We had some Beijing style cuisine with some fusion dishes. Specially, they don’t have Beijing’s roasted duck. Highly recommend to have seafood soup and eggplants.    The interior design presenting the traditional Chinese architecture style, lot of wood and brick. Yeah… some of the wood seats are not really comfortable.    The staffs are friendly.

However, this restaurant cooks all those traditional dishes in a way they look aesthetic, taste authentic (hopefully, just personal opinion)and delicious. It's a bit pricey but definitely is worth the experience. My favorite there might be the treasure platter dessert, signature seafood bisque, and the brown sauce fish.",Chai 柴院 | Authentic Chinese Restaurant,353 W 46th St
1427,3,4,Chinese,5,11/20/2022,"If this is a restaurant in Beijing, the food would be considered so so. However, here in NYC, to be able to have some of the dishes from home, I give the place 5 starts.  To be fair, the atmosphere is good; some of the dishes are great. Priced reasonably (a bit expensive but not too much).  Recommend a visit if you around.",Chai 柴院 | Authentic Chinese Restaurant,353 W 46th St
1428,4,4,Chinese,4,06/23/2022,"Chai was one of the most trendy Chinese restaurants last year and we finally got a chance to give it a try. They serve authentic Beijing Cuisine which is rare in NYC and we are not familiar with it at all.    The decor looks elegant and classy with cozy vibe & limited tables. It’s pretty popular, so sometimes the wait is about 30 mins to 1 hour. There wasn’t a great variety of options on their menu, but we still had a hard time making up our mind since most of the dishes looked great.    We got their Chai’s Treasures Platter, Beijing Cabbage, Signature Seafood Bisque, Braised Whole Fish with Brown Sauce, Beijing Style Eggplant, Braised Pork Intestine and Black Truffle & Beef Fried Rice to share with a group of four.    The portion was pretty decent with a little high price, but the taste was overall delicate and they even peeled the eggplants to make the texture softer. Our favorites were the appetizing cabbage and satisfying fish. We won’t recommend the fried rice since we could barely taste the flavor of truffle.",Chai 柴院 | Authentic Chinese Restaurant,353 W 46th St
1429,5,4,Chinese,4,01/19/2023,"Overall a decent Beijing style restaurant. Decor is beautiful and most dishes are aesthetically pleasing, but flavor was inconsistent.

The Vegan Twice-Cooked Pork  Both vegan types of meat are delicious and healthy alternatives to traditional beef and pork dishes. This plant-based dish boasts a unique combination of flavors and textures that are satisfying and nutritious.",Chai 柴院 | Authentic Chinese Restaurant,353 W 46th St
1431,7,4,Chinese,5,03/20/2023,"Located in midtown NYC, Chai is a Chinese restaurant that specializes in Beijing cuisine. Although I wasn't familiar with the food, browsing the menu online convinced me to give it a try.    Upon arriving, I was struck by the warm and cozy atmosphere of the restaurant. The classic decor added to the experience. The extensive menu made it difficult to decide what to order, but with the help of the server, I was able to choose a variety of dishes to try.    To start, I was served the sour and spicy chicken, a cold dish that consisted of bone-in chicken mixed with Thai chili and vinegar sauce. The combination of spice and sourness made for an appetizing introduction to the meal. The duck roll was also a hit, with a perfectly crispy exterior and a generous filling of vegetables and duck.    The server recommended the signature seafood bisque, which I found to be exceptional. The soup boasted a variety of Chinese favorite seafood, such as sea cucumber, fish maw, abalone, and beef tendon, in a thick broth that was both delicate and rich.    One standout dish was the Hutong Pork Organ Stew, a delicious concoction of pork intestines, pork heart, and fried tofu in a thick, brown gravy. I also ordered the eggs in the meatballs, which were braised in a delicious sauce and reminded me of scotch eggs. The two dishes complemented each other well and paired perfectly with white rice.    For dessert, I indulged in Chai's Treasure Platter, which featured traditional Chinese sweets such as pea cake, bean rolls, snow balls, and rolling donkey. The flavors were delightful, and none were too sweet.    Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal at Chai. The cozy ambiance, extensive menu, and exceptional dishes made for a memorable dining experience.",Chai 柴院 | Authentic Chinese Restaurant,353 W 46th St
1432,8,4,Chinese,4,05/19/2022,"Wait staff were nice, but they forget a couple orders. Came for lunch and dinner on the same day due to a meeting and a date, both times they forgotten items on the order. Overall the service was very professional and attentive. The food were presented well however they were generally very bland. Most of the dishes felt like they were missing an extra pinch of spice or salt, I was hunger for that second layer of complexity. I generally like don’t like strong favors or spicy, but their food was lacking quite a bit of favor for me. Fortunately the deserts had the most favors and were extremely delicious. I had the cheesy rabbit which I thought was incredible. Their pear soup and plum juice were decent.",Chai 柴院 | Authentic Chinese Restaurant,353 W 46th St
1433,9,4,Chinese,5,11/20/2022,"Chai is one of the best authentic Chinese restaurants that I've been to in a long while! This place specializes in Beijing / Peking cuisines and is very authentic! Service was excellent as well, which has been harder to come by since the pandemic.    I would especially recommend ordering the Beijing Beef Tripe - mixing it well with the sesame sauce + chili oil + cilantro provided is perfection! Everything else we ordered were very good as well: especially the shredded pork with Beijing sauce (very authentic!), braised whole fish in brown sauce, and braised pork belly in brown sauce. For noodle dishes I would recommend the Beijing Zha Jiang Noodles.    As for drinks - we ordered this Chinese Bai Jiu (56% alcohol) that was fun to drink along with the food - can treat it like a shot, or goes pretty well with the food.    Last quick note - I hope they do bring back Peking duck though, didn't see it in the menu when I went for dinner, but I saw this in some older pictures.",Chai 柴院 | Authentic Chinese Restaurant,353 W 46th St

1447,25,4,Chinese,5,05/19/2022,Like the overall food quality. Interior and generous seat spacing are great too. It’s a bit unfortunate that they don’t serve the peking duck today. We will likely come back another day to try other dishes.    It’s more like 4 stars in my mind but I feel like the overall 4.3 stars (as of jan 2022) is slightly harsh in US standard. Therefore the 5 here.    BTW I don’t think they take reservations. Walk-in only.,Chai 柴院 | Authentic Chinese Restaurant,353 W 46th St

Pear soup I ordered was room temperature, it would be perfect if it could be colder. Beef tripes dish was warm but it should be a cold dish. Black pepper beef is nice but quite oily. I don’t know how Beijing ppl eat their fish but the yellow croaker dish is nothing to do with the broth, kinda meaningless if you really wanna try this place then you have to order the seafood bisque unless u are not a msg person. That’s probably the only thing I ever said good during the whole dinner.",Chai 柴院 | Authentic Chinese Restaurant,353 W 46th St
1451,29,4,Chinese,5,05/12/2023,Absolutely delicious. Vibes are super intimate and chill. Great place to take a breath and eat good food. Highly recommend. We just walked in bc looked good from the outside and it’s now one of our favorite spots  …,Chai 柴院 | Authentic Chinese Restaurant,353 W 46th St
1452,30,4,Chinese,4,01/19/2023,"As someone who grew up in Beijing, I found this place serving very close to authentic Beijing cuisine.    There are lots of items on the menu that fall under Beijing cusine whereas some don't.    Ordered beef tripe with sesame paste - instant nostalgic taste. Try this if you like tahini.    Dessert tray: you have to order this! Beijing desserts and they taste very like originals!!! I miss home even looking at it.    Cabbage with mustard: this is another Beijing cuisine. It's very very spicy with hint of mustard. The spiciness isn't like Szechuan food but rather like you're chewing horseradish:)    Braise pork belly: I really like this one but it doesn't stand out compare to other Chinese restaurants.    Meatball - okay. They put eggs in the meatball which is interesting    Prime beef - this is not even Chinese cuisine. The meat tastes very tender however under seasoned.    House soup: more like Southern Chinese cuisine but it's very hearty    Overall I recommend this place and will probably visit again.    Note that: 1) they no longer have Peking roast duck 2) no reservations available. On Friday and weekends the wait is 30-45 min.    Update on 1/10/2023:  Revisit after they opened for a while. The wait is within 10min on weekday evenings but all people in your party have to be present in order to get seated.    Ordered braised whole fish with pancake. It's tasty and portion is okay but a little greasy. Not very authentic Beijing food but good enough. Service is still very accommodating and friendly.",Chai 柴院 | Authentic Chinese Restaurant,353 W 46th St

I’m originally from Beijing so I’ve been expecting some good Beijing food for a while, and also this was for me&my partner anniversary - 3 out of 5 dishes were disappointing: the shredded pork is way too sweet, and the green fish in the middle (why so green???)  is way tooo plain with only cucumber flavorthe black pepper beef is just so plain…… the portion was small as well. So we ended up paying ~$85 per person for a meal which is very disappointing. Won’t come back again.",Chai 柴院 | Authentic Chinese Restaurant,353 W 46th St

1459,37,4,Chinese,5,04/19/2023,"A friend treated us to this place and the food was amazing. It makes Beijing/Northern Chinese cusines with a tiny twist of modern/Western. If you are not feeling adventurous or not ready for the more exotic chinese food, they've got general tsos chicken and orange chicken on the menu as well (which we did not care to try). Our friend ordered hand pulled cabbage with creamy peanut sauce, stir-fried julienned potatoes, a tripe salad with peanut dressing, sweet and sour pork, sliced tofu skin wraps, some dark, soy saucy shredded pork that you eat with tofu skins, and abalone soup/porridge. It was really hard to pick a favorite as everything we tried was a joy to our palates. The dishes can cost a bit more than regular Chinese food but it was well worth it.",Chai 柴院 | Authentic Chinese Restaurant,353 W 46th St

Our server did not take down everything I said despite that he repeated everything after I ordered. They forgot our soup until all main dishes were finished. They also served our rice lastly. Who eats rice after the entrees? The food itself was so below average. Our sizzling plate lamb was way too salty that I couldn’t even finish them. Overall, I would not come in again and suggest you to find another authentic Chinese restaurant in town.",Chai 柴院 | Authentic Chinese Restaurant,353 W 46th St
1464,42,4,Chinese,5,03/20/2023,"You know what? I just figured out Chai offers Vegetarian options! That was my first time trying vegetarian cuisine with Chinese flavors. The food was amazing - the vegan beef w, black pepper, and shredded vegan pork in spicy garlic sauce were a standout dish, and the stir-fried string beans were fresh and flavorful. The prices were also very reasonable for the quality of food and service.",Chai 柴院 | Authentic Chinese Restaurant,353 W 46th St

1467,45,4,Chinese,2,05/19/2022,"Two stars for the deco and presentation.    One star for food. Mediocre at best, not justifying the $$$price tag at all.  They come in small portions. So be prepared to order a lot to fill your belly.  Many dishes were not available, including Peking Duck and some supposedly signature dim sums. leaving us narrower options.    Waiters forgot to refill the tea pot, even upon multiple requests. They were apologetic about a couple of other remisses, trying to make up with two free deserts which were tiiiiiiiny - not sure how to split it among us nine people Loll",Chai 柴院 | Authentic Chinese Restaurant,353 W 46th St

1470,49,4,Chinese,3,01/19/2023,"I went yesterday, their food is delicious, there weren't many people and when they served me the starter and the main course at the same time, so I could eat quickly before it got cold.  When I had half of my main course left, a waiter came to my table on several occasions with his machine (the terminal) and he asked me if I wanted the bill, to which at one point he bothered me and I told him to stop wanting me to I go. He did this with me, a Latino, and with another table that seemed to be from another country with brown skin. I think this restaurant has racist overtones. How sad that we continue to see these behaviors when the waiters don't even speak English well.",Chai 柴院 | Authentic Chinese Restaurant,353 W 46th St

1481,63,4,Chinese,1,01/19/2023,"The regional manager is incapable of speaking to the customers in a civilized manner:  We waited an hour to eat and there’s no area for people to wait… we left the umbrella in the reception area and told their staff to watch it .. after we are done eating the umbrella is gone and they can’t find it…….we were able to reach out to their regional manager a very ill tempered old woman. She was very uncivilized and rude, wasted a tremendous amount of our time and did not resolve the issue for us.",Chai 柴院 | Authentic Chinese Restaurant,353 W 46th St
1482,64,4,Chinese,1,01/19/2023,"My friend recommended us to this restaurant. It is a rainy day so we asked the receptionist to take care of the umbrella while we eat, after we finished our lunch the umbrella is gone. The workers at the restaurant refused to help or check the surveillance camera for us, or take any responsibility for the missing umbrella. My friend gave this restaurant a one star review because of it, and then the restaurant’s regional manager called saying that our one star review does not matter and that we wasted her time    Do not visit this restaurant, unless you want to deal with an absurd uncivilized manager that allows your things to be stolen.",Chai 柴院 | Authentic Chinese Restaurant,353 W 46th St

My roommate and I order from it on daily basis. Sometimes we also go to dine in. Chai is a restaurant with standards. The food taste just as good from delivery as we dine in. The taste of the food is just amazing, very true Chinese taste which will satisfy both the Eastern and the Western stomach. The staff in Chai are extremely friendly and supportive. Today I ordered something online and the item did not come as requested. Sean from Chai reached out to me and helped me solved all this out. I’m so touched!!! THANK YOU Chai thank you Sean! We will keep ordering from you!!!!!",Chai 柴院 | Authentic Chinese Restaurant,353 W 46th St
1485,67,4,Chinese,2,04/19/2023,"Expensive, the food is small and careless. The rice is not fresh and tasted like heated from microwave. They don’t have Beijing Duck anymore and I don’t see anything else worth trying at this place",Chai 柴院 | Authentic Chinese Restaurant,353 W 46th St
1486,68,4,Chinese,5,04/19/2023,"I sampled duck rolls, shrimp tartare, pan-fried dumplings, pork soup dumplings, crispy hairtail, and sweet & sour ribs.

1490,72,4,Chinese,2,02/18/2023,"Been to this place a few times and I gotta say the food they serve is quite the opposite of authentic Beijing cuisine. I know it can be hard to get ingredients for certain Chinese dishes, but I couldn’t think of any excuse for the very bland zhajiangmian and the super chewy baodu. These are simply examples of bad cooking. Making the menu even more disastrous was the yellow fish with its funny omakase look and salty smell. They sure love to pour the sticky, starchy abalone sauce on almost everything, fearing unpleasant smell underneath get exposed. Meanwhile the restaurant doesn’t seem to handle criticism very well, another thing inexcusable. Chai might prove an appeal for younger Chinese immigrants who fancy taking instagrammable photos to share on Xiaohongshu, but it just has a long way to catch up…",Chai 柴院 | Authentic Chinese Restaurant,353 W 46th St

I put my name on the waitlist and waited until 6:45 ish. They told me the table was ready and they were cleaning the table. However, I waited another  10 mins and they were still cleaning the table. The girl at the front desk was a rude robot and the only thing she knew was repeating we are still working on to get the table ready. please avoid this restaurant and avoid wasting your time. There are a lot of good Chinese restaurants out there. This one only looks good from outside but the management is the worst I ever seen.",Chai 柴院 | Authentic Chinese Restaurant,353 W 46th St

Fried rice was cold when first presented. The manager offered to replace the fried rice and the new one was not hot as well…  2. I cannot distinguish the lamb from beef. I could only taste soy sauce from the dish.  3. The broth of tofu and seafood bisque are extremely similar. I feel like having duplicated dishes.  4. We cannot split the bill for more than 2 people.

1543,126,4,Chinese,5,05/19/2022,"My husband and I traipsed over to Hell's Kitchen from Times Square after our matinee today's in search of something new, ethnic and unique -- and we found it at Chai on 46th Street in Restaurant Row!!. Wonderful authentic Chinese food, in a lovely peaceful setting. I felt myself relax as soon as I sat down and it severe bright over a pot of tea...Beautiful artwork.  Elegant, yet not too formal; Chinese families with little kids, many young adults and teens the evening that we went there. Wonderful service, friendly helpful staff guided us thru our meal selections. It was also an excellent value for the money.    We enjoyed cabbage salad with peanut sauce and a duck roll for our appetizers, seafood soup which is a specialty, General Tso's chicken (very hot, very sweet), and an unusual dish with pork meatball around an egg. For dessert we consulted our neighbors who suggested Four Treasures Platter - now that was different! Everything was delicious.",Chai 柴院 | Authentic Chinese Restaurant,353 W 46th St

1555,139,4,Chinese,1,05/19/2022,"We called at at 8:09pm asking about availability and they said the last call was at 9:00pm. We said no problem, that we can arrive in <15m. Then they said they wouldn’t admit us unless we were there by 8:30pm. We hailed a taxi, arrived at 8:17, and when we walked in they immediately turned us away. We mention that we had JUST called and hailed a cab to arrive well in advance of their deadlines, but they still refused us. While we were there discussing this, a table of at least 4 stood up and left, freeing a table. We said we could wait for them to clean it, and they said that table would not be available after cleaning. We were just a party of 2, not like a large party or anything.    Finally we left, disappointed that they hadn’t communicated clearly that they wouldn’t be admitting us even though we had spoken on the phone just 8 minutes before, having been led to believe that we would be admitted.    I had been a loyal customer before this event and had recommended this restaurant to many friends, but after this experience tonight, I’m sorry, I can no longer recommend this restaurant.

I wanted to try their signature dish (the duck) but I was told they are updating their oven and not serving it.  The other dishes are fine but not impressive.

1560,145,4,Chinese,4,05/19/2022,"Concluding from my second visit: This place is not that bad. Waiter has been much more professional, and the dishes we ordered this time were all good. Like the golden soup a lot. Good authentic taste and more fancy deco than Beijing cuisine usually has. Still a little pricy for main dishes but mostly worth it    *******************  Below are the 3-star comment when I first visit this place in September:  Liked the treasure platter a lot.  But sad that I have to say, being a Beijing Cuisine restaurant (which is quite rare in the city?) their Peking duck is quite disappointing tbh.  And was so annoyed by the boneless beef rib, 8 pieces of meat costs $32, placed on a bone which obviously they will reuse? And the beef was flavorless.  Zhajiang noodle was also good, happy that they provide like 6 toppings for it. However when the waiter distribute the noodle to our bowls there’s only noodles. Topping all stayed bottom of the main bowl. Really need to learn how to serve..  Last but not least were a bit annoyed by the all the waiter in some way. Maybe it was the soft opening so they were trying too hard to be nice so speak/act too much.. Might get better when they get busy :)",Chai 柴院 | Authentic Chinese Restaurant,353 W 46th St

1563,148,4,Chinese,5,06/23/2022,The signature seafood bisque and golden fish are so good! My friends all agree,Chai 柴院 | Authentic Chinese Restaurant,353 W 46th St

1565,150,4,Chinese,4,05/19/2022,"We orders 10+ dishes and most of them did taste good compared to the other Chinese restaurants in New York. They have authentic Northern Chinese dishes that you can't find anywhere else in NY.    The sweet and sour pork was the best among the dishes we ordered. Yellow croaker in golden soup was good. Braised sea cucumber, zha jiang noodle, chicken stew, the treasure platter and duck fried rice were okay. Beijing shredded pork was too sweet and didn't taste like Beijing food, more like Shanghai food.    Because of soft opening, lots of popular dishes were out of stock, such as the Beijing duck (the duck oven was broken and no estimated fixed date). The open time was not correct either. They only opened at 12:30pm on Saturday whilst we were there 11:30pm as stated on the Google Map. Be prepared when you decide to go as you don't know how long you will be waiting for. However, they served dishes fairly quick. We received all dishes within 50 mins after ordering I would say.    It's a little pricy - I would say $50 - $100 per person. The dish size was SMALL, very small. Think about shanghai/jiangzhe food - that's the size you can get from Chai, but delicate for sure.    I would definitely come back for the taste of the dishes (tier 1 in NY), but not for the overall experience yet (wait time, dish availability, operation) until the grand opening.",Chai 柴院 | Authentic Chinese Restaurant,353 W 46th St

It features tofu cubes in a gently spicy sauce, occasionally containing ground meat and frequently served atop rice. The mapo tofu here had a delectable flavor with a more bean sauce component. The spiciness was subtle, not as heavy as one might find at other Chinese restaurants. Overall, the experience was truly delightful.",Chai 柴院 | Authentic Chinese Restaurant,353 W 46th St

8035,2,18,Chinese,1,10/21/2022,"Food is okay, but if you want to have some authentic Chinese food or great Dim Sim you should find another place.    I feel horrible on how we were treated -  we ordered 4 dishes. The waiter clearly took our order and confirmed with us. But after an hour we only got three. We asked if our last dish was ready but the waiter did not even want to find out what's going on. There was no service, either. For an hour nobody came to us, and we had to walk to the waiter asking for more water. It took forever to get our check - asked three times but it was not brought to us.    We had to step to the cashier to pay our bill. Decided to tip 10% based on what we received. The cashier was mad at us. She asked, word to word, ""Are you new to the U.S?""???? This was a shocking question and I explained why it was 10%. The cashier then arrogantly told us that ""no need to tip if you can't bear it. We don't care about your $8""... This is unbelievable. I NEVER tip less than 15% unless the service is too bad, and yes, the service we received here was too bad.",Tri Dim Shanghai Restaurant and Bar 鼎豐 [UES],1378 3rd Ave
8036,3,18,Chinese,4,12/20/2022,"The food is good and they are willing to make accommodations to menu when ordering if you are vegetarian, ie. Shanghai rice noodles can be made vegetarian. They are extremely busy with the take out/delivery business, so you have to ignore the bustle and noise of the delivery men through the aisles. Some of the wait staff can be rude, and don't bother to check on the meal. Delivery is probably a better option if you want a quiet dinner.",Tri Dim Shanghai Restaurant and Bar 鼎豐 [UES],1378 3rd Ave

We liked the Crispy Peking duck roll and the vegetarian dishes we ordered were pretty good. The Dry Sauteed Crispy Shredded Beef was neither dry or crispy and had no flavor beyond that of beef. It should be tangy with a gooey glaze. Avoid the Szechuan Bouillabaisse. We understand that some restaurants often cater to what the locals like rather than being true to the cuisine. We simply expected better. The hint was on the way out. We were the only ones in the restaurant using chop sticks.",Tri Dim Shanghai Restaurant and Bar 鼎豐 [UES],1378 3rd Ave

Our waiter recommended the crispy beef,  fried rice, soup dumplings, prawns and scallops. All were winners but the stand out was the crispy beef! So full of flavor with the perfect amount of crisp!    We also ordered the peking crispy duck roll and the BBQ ribs. The duck roll was big enough to share and full of that decedent duck flavor.

Soup dumplings were the best I ever had in Manhattan, comparing to famous soup dumpling places. Simple stir fried veggie dishes were phanomenon! We were so impressed. The service was like five stars.  In addition, its kid friendly! We had a stroller with us. We were able to park it next to our table. Overall was a wonderful experience.

8047,16,18,Chinese,2,11/20/2022,"This was my #1 favorite Chinese takeout in the UES until an extremely unfortunate takeout experience last night. I have a life threatening soy allergy (anaphylaxis) and had previously ordered without issues. I called ahead to ask about the Singapore noodles, and asked the employee who picked up to check with the kitchen on whether there were any bean sprouts/soy in it. She said no without hesitation and said to just include my food allergies in comments on the order. I detailed the allergy in comments then ordered through the Chow Now app.    When the delivery gentleman arrived (I'm not sure he if he's directly linked with the restaurant) he asked for cash tip, I apologized and let him know I didn't have cash but said I call the restaurant rightaway to give tip on my credit card from the order. He took the food back and called the restaurant on his phone, and told me to give the restaurant my credit card number in the middle of my apt hallway. I said I wasn't comfortable with that and that I would call in just a moment before he reluctantly left.    Just when I was calling the restaurant, I took a bite of the noodles, took a closer look and realized there were bean sprouts mixed into the noodles. I immediately took Benadryl as I began to develop a rash/oral itching. The restaurant called me and when I picked up and let them know what was happening, she said she was sorry about the mistake and that she could refund the noodles, but insisted for my card number for the tip...as I was actively experiencing a food reaction. When the manager finally got on the phone and said they would do a full refund, I made it clear to him that as an food establishment it's extremely important to take food allergies seriously, not just nonchalantly reassure someone that a dish is ok before disregarding the allergy and putting a customer at risk. I'm mostly disappointed that I likely will no longer feel safe eating here.    TLDR; great Chinese in UES if you don't have any food allergies-- if you do have food allergies, think again before eating here",Tri Dim Shanghai Restaurant and Bar 鼎豐 [UES],1378 3rd Ave

8049,18,18,Chinese,1,12/20/2022,"If I could have given this place 0 stars I would have. Extremely Horrible customer service from the seater/waiter. I came with my family of four Monday 11/21 around 5:30 p.m. and we were brought to a table by this seater/waiter. We respectfully asked if we can have another table after it was offered by the seater/waiter. We were moved to an open inner room with a table nearby a window. But what happens next utterly shocked  my family and I. This seater/waiter abruptly placed  our 4 menus on top of each of our eating plates and napkins. He did this instead of placing them on the side of the plates , like he did at the previous table. Also, I have never experienced any seater/waiter in any previous restaurant ever placing any menu ( which are dirty because of previous handling by others) on top of a customer’s eating plates and napkins. When I brought this to his attention ( while my family and I were still standing in shock) he answered back rather annoyed and with a sarcastic half smile/tone and told me  oh thats what I do. I put the menus on top of the plates. I told him that it was disgusting and unprofessional to do that. He objected and I told him well thats is definitely wrong and disgusting and I would like new plates and napkins. He abruptly said ok and grabbed up everything but it looked like he never changed the plates and just put new napkins on the original ones. I was watching as he took them over to a plate station and he quickly in plain view from what I can tell, just placed new napkins on the original plates. I instructed my family (we all still standing) that we were now leaving and would patron a new restaurant instead. We left and headed to Jing Fong  restaurant a few blocks away. Very poor and disgusting service at Tri Dim Shanghai West but more importantly this seater/waiter. 0 stars!!!",Tri Dim Shanghai Restaurant and Bar 鼎豐 [UES],1378 3rd Ave

8080,51,18,Chinese,2,05/20/2019,"Food was just okay. Noodles a little too greasy for my taste. Positive note is their shrimp and broccoli is good.    Service left a bit to be desired and whatever you do, don't order noodles with beef because whatever it is they call beef sure isn't.  Not by looks, taste, or texture.    An entire dish was left behind by a friend with all that mystery meat.  We all know what beef looks smells, tastes like and texture is like having eaten various dishes from all different cultures.  When asked what kind of meat it was in the dish the server smiled with a wry smile and  proclaimed it to be beef.  We left unconvinced.    Note to the wise if it doesn't look like, taste like, feel like, or smell like beef chances are it isn't.",Tri Dim Shanghai Restaurant and Bar 鼎豐 [UES],1378 3rd Ave
8081,52,18,Chinese,3,05/19/2020,"Nice, authentic, and reasonably priced menu options, but flavor in food a bit uneven. Tried a couple of distinct dumplings and they were great; spring rolls a bit simple; shredded pork was delightful, yet fried rice was somewhat plain. I can say though that food went down really well which probably means fresh and quality ingredients were used throughout. I'm dropping one star because service was a bit sub par, though. At late lunch we were essentially the only people in the restaurant and food took a long time to come out, and were waited by two guys, only one of which acted professionally. Contempt on a waiter is not something you'd expect in a top-rated establishment. All in all, I would probably visit again to try more dumpling/bun/shumai styles.",Tri Dim Shanghai Restaurant and Bar 鼎豐 [UES],1378 3rd Ave

Appears from greetings that a lot of the patrons are regulars and many are senior citizens. Unfortunately the chicken used in my dish was full of skin and fat under the light coating. Never experienced this before in Chinese restaurants. Had to go to my neighborhood rest the next day and order same to get the bad taste/experience out of my head.

A very comfortable lounge area in the front to sit and enjoy a cocktail before dinner. Excellent dim sum - soup wontons are a must!

Honestly, we’ve been here many times recently, and there isn’t an item that we haven’t tried that isn’t delicious (youngchow fried rice, shrimp balls, soup dumplings, kung pao chicken, pea shoots, spring rolls).

Xihu Beef soup is 8.5 but it a little bowl for one person. What’s worse is when we check and fill in tips the server is looking at us making us very comfortable.

A good selection of tasty dim sum options and Chinese dishes with fast and attentive service in a calm environment.

The soup dumplings were good, probably can use more parchment paper to completely seat all the dumplings.

I didn’t know that between the hours of 3-5 the kitchen is closed . I didn’t feel like waiting so I googled for another dim sum location and this place was a few blocks away . I am so happy I found this place . It was perfect because it was practically empty (probably because it was a Monday and it was raining all day) . The dim sum was the best I’ve eaten .

I loved the peashoots and the fried rice and sole with bean sauce were solid as well. Sweet dishes were VERY sweet so beware!    Better decorated than most but still not fancy.  More expensive than other Chinese restaurants but seems like higher quality.  Wines by the glass not pricey or exceptional but pair just fine!  Service was solid if a tad over eager.

I love Shangainese cuisine and was overjoyed to see some of these dishes offered on a menu in the UWS. The sauteed pea shoots are a dream. They even have a make your own veggie dish and you can pick the sauce/add animal protein if you want. We also have gluten allergies in the house and have not had Chinese food in ages, but they were so friendly over the phone and provided us with options, then even called when they received the order to follow up and confirm who was eating what dish to prevent any mix-ups. Delivery was much quicker than anticipated. Huge new fans of this place!",Tri Dim Shanghai West Restaurant and Bar 鼎豐 [UWS],467 Columbus Ave
8780,55,21,Chinese,5,05/19/2020,"It's nice to find an upscale Chinese restaurant on the Upper West Side.   Much better than Shun Lee, at about half the price.   The decor was modern and upscale, with linen table clothes and napkins.  The service was highly professional- friendly and attentive without being intrusive.  And the food was really good!  I had the chicken with 3 kinds of nuts, with honey walnuts adding a sweet flavor to the juicy brown sauce chicken.  I also had pea shoots which were sauteed in a very flavorful garlic sauce.   Save room for desserts, which were quite remarkable too.   This place is going on my short list of favored restaurants.",Tri Dim Shanghai West Restaurant and Bar 鼎豐 [UWS],467 Columbus Ave
8781,56,21,Chinese,4,05/19/2022,"Well first off, I ordered delivery from this place and I kid you not, it arrived in 7 minutes. Not even an exaggeration. I ordered at 6:17, and it arrived at 6:24. Which is insane to me. Even if this restaurant was located inside my apartment building, I would not expect my meal to be ready in 7 minutes. So I don't know how they did that and it's possible they set a Guinness World Record for fastest delivery.    Unfortunately though, as pleased as I was with the fast delivery, the food was very average. It wasn't BAD. I ate every single bit of food that was given to me. But I've had better. I ordered the chicken lo mein. There was hardly any chicken in it which was a bummer. And the lo mein itself, like I said, was just average.

Had the scallion pancakes, pork soup dumplings, shrimp fried rice and rice cake with beef. Only draw back on the dishes was that I felt there should have been more given the price. Service was good and servers were quick and attentive, even providing hot tea instead of tap water which was appreciated.",Tri Dim Shanghai West Restaurant and Bar 鼎豐 [UWS],467 Columbus Ave
8784,59,21,Chinese,1,05/19/2020,"I suspect the 5 star reviews here are employees or friends, because the food here is simply not good. Inedible, in fact. The previous Chinese restaurant at this address, Canteen 82, had great food, and a much more friendly staff. The people here at Tri Dim are nice enough, but all-business. I've tried the soup dumplings, the spring roll, and general tso's chicken, as well as mapo tofu. All were just awful. Bad flavors, bad quality ingredients, just not good. Even the fortune cookie tasted weird.

Half road duck served by the waiter, who made very neat roll ups with scallions and housing sauce, are a standout. Eggplant with garlic a bit too heavy on the sweetish sauce for me.

10734,1,26,Chinese,5,10/21/2022,I ate a whole rotisserie chicken with yellow rice at Flor de Mayo.    Scrumptious! Delicious! Amazing! Finger licking good! Need I say more?

10735,2,26,Chinese,5,09/21/2022,"Haven't been here in many years. My favorite was the steak sandwich and they dont serve it anymore.

This place is still very unique.",Flor de Mayo Restaurant,2651 Broadway
10736,3,26,Chinese,4,05/19/2022,"Food is rather good and inexpensive, portions are large and service is good and fast. Appetizer papas arequipena was interesting and tasty. While the tallarin verde with carne salteado was great, kung pao was mediocre at best, which is why this is a 4 star review.",Flor de Mayo Restaurant,2651 Broadway
10737,4,26,Chinese,4,05/19/2022,"Overall, it is a good place to eat for many people on a budget.  The service I will say is phenomenal.  They are quick to sit you and take your order.  They come around and check several times and will keep your water cups filled.  Excellent in explaining what is served and also understand Spanish very well.  Where it lost a star was the lack of ANY dessert and the cooking of the vegetable on the special meals.  I ordered a flan only to find out it was sold out last minute.  My companies ordered king po chicken and shrimp and both plates came with undercook vegetable.  Although the sauce got great reviews the large plate was mostly disguised with vegetables that was more raw than cooked.  Will come back again but will stay away from the special plates that might be filled with more undercook vegetable.",Flor de Mayo Restaurant,2651 Broadway
10738,5,26,Chinese,4,05/19/2022,Loved the place. The service was excellent..especially attentive wait staff.  The food though is what people go there for and it did not dissappoint.

10740,7,26,Chinese,4,12/20/2022,Very good service with good food but  overpriced unless you go for the lunch special. I know it’s the city but come on $25 for a pint of Lo Mein. I’ve had much better for 9.00 dollars.,Flor de Mayo Restaurant,2651 Broadway

10742,9,26,Chinese,4,06/23/2022,"Good food, good vibes! As a vegetarian I wasnt sure they would have something for me. They had Lomo Tofu. The tofu was bland as is expected from most restaurants. They just don't take the time to make it tasty. My husband thoroughly enjoyed his lomo saltada steak. Pina colada had the right amount of alcohol to give you a light buzz. Food came  fairly quickly. Bathroom had no hand soap.  Most items cost close to$20 so expect to spend between $40 and $50 per person for a meal and drink. Appetizer not included in that price.",Flor de Mayo Restaurant,2651 Broadway

10748,15,26,Chinese,5,02/18/2023,"The place has become extremely popular as of late.  Growing up in the 80s and 90s, I would go to the location between 83rd and 84th Street, and remember the food being awesome.  Now 20+ years later when I have the opportunity, I go to the one on 101st and Broadway and their food is just as good as I remember.  It was a Saturday, so it was a bit busy, and we had to wait about 30 minutes for a table,  but it was worth it.  I had the chicken and broccoli dish, but it's not your typical Chinese fast-food style.  Freshly steamed broccoli, topped with chicken and sauce, enough to ensure you have left overs for the next day.  Check them out, they are worth the trip and wait.",Flor de Mayo Restaurant,2651 Broadway
10749,16,26,Chinese,4,02/18/2023,"This was my first time coming to Flor de Mayo. The food was full of flavor and delicious. The food came to our table in less than 15 mins. The fusion mix of Chinese/Peruvian blends well together. Service and speed was great on a Friday night. The sangria pitcher was good too. Waiter could have been more considerate in regards to payment. Overall, I would recommend Flor de Mayo to anyone who is into fusion cuisine.",Flor de Mayo Restaurant,2651 Broadway
10750,17,26,Chinese,5,02/18/2023,The food is delicious. Ribs with black bean sauce is my favorite meal. My wife’s favorite is the fried pork chops with house special fried rice. Go see for yourself. You will not have any regrets.,Flor de Mayo Restaurant,2651 Broadway

The food is good and drinks are super strong. For my first time I had the lomo and fried rice, but I am looking forward to trying their other dishes.

10752,19,26,Chinese,1,02/18/2023,"It was very ratchet and the food was very flavorless, then super spicy for other parts of the course. The Spanish food was actually flavorful and delicious but the Chinese food was disgusting. Better off just leaving it as being a Spanish restaurant.

I haven't came here in quite awhile, I decided to stop by since I was in the neighborhood omw to my overnight shift. Upon arriving I noticed the restaurant is under new management. I made an order to go. I ordered a steak well done as I am pregnant. Along with mixed fried rice,sweet plantain and added avocado to my salad....  I never once checked my bag before I left the restaurant. On my break I opened my order and to my dismay I found an undercooked steak with blood literally oozing out!!!with white rice no plantain.  I was utterly disgusted as I have never experienced this before.  I did not even eat anything during my whole shift. When I called the next day I was told there no manager available for me to speak to. I called back only to be offered a store credit that I did not care for. Who said I'd be ordering from there again? I practically had to beg for a refund.  They refunded me what they saw fit to refund me which was some bs They were rude and nasty.  I will never order food from here again.",Flor de Mayo Restaurant,2651 Broadway

Spanish menu and Latin food good mix. Portion size was good no one finished all there food. Lost a star due to noise and cramped up spaces small aisles to walk and you barely have elbow room. More suited for friends and family not a date night. Married normal date nights yes not the special ones. ",Flor de Mayo Restaurant,2651 Broadway

10801,71,26,Chinese,1,05/19/2020,"Service was good.  We tried roasted chicken and lomo saltado (see picture ). The chicken was ok.  The lomo saltado was off, not cooked properly, the fries were saggy, the onions were not crispy, the rice was kind of fishy, the meat was not good quality and the tomatoes were extremely hard.  It’s a simple dish hard to make. Perhaps my review is a little harsh; there was no sauce or kick to the lomo saltado.  For dessert they only have flan. Glad I came to this place, and tried on my own.   Def not coming back in the near future.",Flor de Mayo Restaurant,2651 Broadway

There is a round table near the fish tank that seats six comfortably. Service was excellent, they were very attentive and constantly cleared the tables. The dishes didn't take long to come out also.    -Aquadito rice soup with cilantro was a great starter. It is a comfort dish and goes great with their tasty bread which is unlimited  -Plantains are large, plump and delicious  -Whole chicken was moist and seasoned well. The vinegar dip adds another layer of lfavor.  -Paella was less than stellar. There was too much rice and just a few pieces of seafood and protein.    Excellent value.

10813,83,26,Chinese,1,07/23/2022,"This place may have been a great place some time ago, but nowadays I can't even tell you one thing that is great about it. I arrived there with my friends because we trusted previous reviews. What a disappointment.  My husband got the bone-in fried chicken.  I have no idea where they found this tiny pigeon, now the kicker is that they cut the thigh into 2 pieces, and did the same with the wing, it was sad and then to top it, it was tasteless. It's supposed to be latin Chinese, we order the house fried rice. 1 shrimp was in it split in half! Who does that. Flavor?-0. One of my friends had the sweet and sour pork, which consisted in a tasteless breaded cut up pork chop and a bowl of ""sweet and sour"" on the side, with yellow Spanish rice, and if he wanted fried rice he would have to pay for a full order. I ordered a pork chop dish which I really only wanted a side order and was told I could not have, at least this was the only edible thing. Oh, and the ice water was crisp and cold. The service was ok but unfortunately we tip based on the terrible food and the their slick order policies.  Avoid at all cost or you'll regret it.",Flor de Mayo Restaurant,2651 Broadway
10814,84,26,Chinese,4,05/20/2019,I had the lomo salteado I added green rice as extra because it’s been yrs since my mom made it for me. And it came with fries. It was delicious.,Flor de Mayo Restaurant,2651 Broadway

10817,87,26,Chinese,1,05/19/2022,"Took over an hour to receive our food despite ordering as soon as we sat down. Larger parties who arrived/ordered after us received their food before we were even given an updated which we had to ask for from an employee who was not our waiter. Our waiter was so busy sucking up to the party of 6 seated next to us that he forgot we existed and no other employee came to ask if we needed anything when we still had not received our food and later arrivals had. We were ignored, dismissed and and rudely brushed off. We ordered two plates of food and another table next to us order the same thing 15 minutes later and got there food much earlier. The only time staff acknowledged us is when they were desperate to serve us a check so that they could free up the table. Worst customer service I've ever had at a restaurant especially one that I considered a favorite. I would go as far to say that myself and ny friend were being discriminated against. Staff went out of their way to ignore us and check up on other tables right next to us consistently. It went on for over an hour before we had to ask about where our food was and even then we're given a vague and rude response. The funny thing is, the party of 6 seated next to us literally snapped their fingers and got their food right away even though they arrived 15-20 minutes after we were seated and had 4 more people. I will never come here again. Myself nor my friend received any apologies whatsoever. The only time we weren't invisible is when the time to give a tip came up. First time I absolutely refused to leave a tip. I've gotten better service at an Applebee's in the hood.",Flor de Mayo Restaurant,2651 Broadway

We was immediately seated when we walked in. Me and my boyfriend ordered the exact meal and drink. We had non alcoholic pina Colada. I must say..... it was the best pina colada we both had. It drunk it so fast I kept getting brain freeze.    Our meal was also made with love. We both ordered Plantains (fried and sweet), boneless crispy chicken   With fried rice. They even give you the option to add shrimp, egg, or pork in your rice.    We decided this will be our go too place.

I spoke with 3 different waiters and none communicated anything back one even took the menus from us. Finally got to see what's going on and was told no there was no seating available and they had someone else waiting it was clear no one was waiting they just didn't want us to sit indoor. Because we paid $50 Uber my party did not want to leave. We settled for outdoor. I then watched as they continued to walk passed up and continued to ignore us.I then requested again when they were going to take our order I also asked for lights to be put back on and she told me no. with attitude they took the order but before I could finish snatched the menu. we ask for the food well done. of course when it came food cold and meat still raw even the chicken.

10870,143,26,Chinese,1,05/19/2020,Such a disappointment. The food was neither authentic nor flavorful. The service was confused throughout our dinner and mixed things up more than once. Would never try this place again.,Flor de Mayo Restaurant,2651 Broadway

10878,151,26,Chinese,5,05/20/2018,Excellent Chinese squid (ink) fried rice. Squid ink dishes are rare and this is just beyond description. Came here just for this.

10881,154,26,Chinese,5,05/19/2020,The Chinese style squid fried rice is soooooo good. It uses squid ink and the texture is just perfect. The portion is really large.  We also got the steak & fried stir fries. The taste is good too but all the dishes we ordered were a bit too carby so we couldn’t finish it.  The yuca fries was a nice surprise. The yuca was naturally sweet and not dry at all. Definitely the best yuca fries I have had in NY,Flor de Mayo Restaurant,2651 Broadway
10882,155,26,Chinese,4,05/19/2022,The service and the food is very good.  You can sit 3 people comfortable on their tables.   We had 2 couples on a table and it was tight. Restaurant is and always has been small in size.,Flor de Mayo Restaurant,2651 Broadway

10889,162,26,Chinese,1,05/19/2022,"I grew up in this area and I'm saddened by the lack of flavor this place does not posses. Anybody giving this place high marks is misleading or drunk. My wife and I had two classic dishes. I had the Ropa Vieja with Fried Rice and the the Mrs Sweet and Sour Chicken. My dish was amateur and no flavor from the beautiful Spanish culture, I was offended and the Fried Rice tasted like normal take-out rice, def missing its soul.  Now, my wife's dish was more sour than sweet and the sauce was not the classic thick gravy it was slightly above soup.    And the service was terrible.    Save your money.",Flor de Mayo Restaurant,2651 Broadway
10890,163,26,Chinese,5,05/19/2022,Food was prepared the way I asked it to be. Great taste and plenty of food. Fast Service.  A little pricey but for the quality and service it's good.,Flor de Mayo Restaurant,2651 Broadway

Causal Dress *jeans sweater Flats, the food selection is Peruvian , Chinese , Spanish & great Combos.  I selected a Combo of Fried rice Chinese fried chicken, Salad & fried Sweet plantain about $20 give or take, IT WAS AMAZING .  The ambience is very basic but cool for a real causal date, they had a full bar, I did not partake (but it looked very nice).  The area Had Metered parking right out front and regular non paid parking in the blocks . The best part was this being such a Cool spot to eat at such a late hour on a Monday it closed At 12am that day. Hope this was Helpful.",Flor de Mayo Restaurant,2651 Broadway
10896,169,26,Chinese,1,05/20/2019,"I've never had any problems here and i love visiting and ordering from this location but i just had a delivery man refuse to come upstairs after explaining that i had minors with me who i could not leave unattended. He stated that wasn't his problem. Unfortunately while this isn't a problem with the restaurant or the food quality, I have never experience such a rude interaction with a delivery person in my life. Get better delivery men/women. Completely unacceptable.",Flor de Mayo Restaurant,2651 Broadway

There was absolutely nothing special about the place, service, or food. I think I could've gotten better quality food at a much lower cost at any one of the many Spanish or Chinese restaurants in the city. I couldn't understand how so many people were lining up outside for this place. I'd go elsewhere.",Flor de Mayo Restaurant,2651 Broadway

10902,175,26,Chinese,5,05/19/2021,"Well, my brother's birthday was the reason for this covid19 outing. It was a party of four and the wait time was an hour. The front door staff was very patient, pleasant and engaging! I wish I remembered the one guy's name in particular, he was a pleasure and a great customer service guy! So when it was our seat time, the turnover for our table was almost instant. Each seating area is separated by 6+ feet high plexiglass partitions, and every staff member had masks on the whole time. The experience was lit, the food was lit, the whole timing of service was lit, our server was lit and attentive to all our needs! (Lit means excellent btw.) The signature drink, called a Nutcracker, I ordered the super so... 2 actually and I had takeaway food because it was so much and so good! Overall I highly recommend a visit or a takeaway/delivery order.",Flor de Mayo Restaurant,2651 Broadway

Then I finally put some people on to it. I love their fried yucca and the fried rice is wonderful. I love that they give you bread with butter before you order your food. It's bomb. Pina colada is good. I normally get the fried half chicken, but the last time I had it at the Broadway location(yes they have two locations), it tasted like they added too much cinnamon to the chicken or some spice thaade it taste sweet. (At least it tasted like cinnamon to me andy sister). Still one of my fav places to eat. I can eat their fried rice by itself It's that good. I tried lo mein for the first time ever here and it was good.",Flor de Mayo Restaurant,2651 Broadway

I ordered the country duck off the specials and it was not tasty, it was stiff and incredibly hard and bony. I don't really plan on going back here anytime soon and wasting another $20 but if for some reason I do, I will order something else and update my review because it's not really fair to base my review off of one visit.",Flor de Mayo Restaurant,2651 Broadway

There was a bit of a wait, about 30 minutes, since it's a popular spot! Everyone on staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating, with not just our waiter checking on us, but several members of the staff. This place claims to have been the inventor of the Nutcracker. With how delicious it was, I have to believe them! I has the Pina Colada version. For all you sweet drink lovers you'll definitely enjoy it! My meal was the lomo saltado and I chose to have the house special rice. To think that Peruvian food and Chinese food would go so well together!

Secondly, the waiters barely speak English,  it was uncomfortable they kept speaking Spanish. Third, a Chinese employee kept caughting and we were disgusted. The place was not all that for the price they charge. Lastly, the food was decent but the Yellow rice sucks and lacks in flavor. I dont eat nothing Asian but my wife wanted to try it. Glad I was right. Dont go here if you want good food and drinks. Also, they claim Latin infused but don't give beans with your food. And these chinese  people look dirty too",Flor de Mayo Restaurant,2651 Broadway

10938,212,26,Chinese,4,05/20/2019,The food was wonderful and the service was great. The only reason I don't give this place five stars is because there are no refills on drinks. And the lemonade I ordered was a virgin drink of some kind in a cocktail glass. For a sit down dine in restaurant I almost felt like I was in and out of there. Just know that everything is an extra charge. But I must admit. The food was really good!,Flor de Mayo Restaurant,2651 Broadway

The quality and depth of taste were not on par with what I remember from the past. I did enjoy my chuletas, yellow rice, black beans, and maduros. But not with the same enthusiasm. The service is still speedy, and the portions are still large, however the prices are up significantly. All and all I will return...maybe it was just and off night!",Flor de Mayo Restaurant,2651 Broadway

We also ordered a half chicken with yellow rice and red beans and tostones and garlic/lemon shrimp, and a bottle of wine.  It was a ton of food, all nicely prepared. And about $100.  I was pleasantly surprised that on a Thursday night at 8:30, the place was almost full. I think that's a sign of a good restaurant.

If I had to be honest, it's really just your fancier better version of the chinese food from the block. The workers are also really kind which I appreciated. My steak well really good and their fried rice was worth cleaning the plate. If I had one complaint from here it's probably just the drinks.

When asked for ir to be exchanged for fresh rice. The server basically said he will take it back and when asked was he supplying a new fresh dish of rice he answered no they would warm the same plate.

Plus I notice everyone white came up and order got a receipt and when I request my receipt I was told it's being printed out. Guess what I never got it.

10972,246,26,Chinese,1,05/19/2020,"Very disappointed. Ordered over 100 dollars worth of food for a dinner party and they totally messed up. The delivery guy after an hour brought the wrong food, gave us only 1 tub of beans and forgot the rest of the food and left abruptly. Called the restaurant and they said oh he gave your food to someone else and hung up. I called back, they said oh yeah it’s not our fault it’s the delivery guys fault, we’ll send you over another order. After two hours of waiting for some rice and chicken, the food came. Then the manager didn’t comp anything, free dessert, soda, anything and never apologized but just said please don’t write a bad review and it’s not my fault it’s the delivery guys fault. Take responsibility for your employees and try to make the customer happy after you messed up and I had to wait over 2 hours total for dinner. Will not be ordering from them again even though that chicken is very tasty. If I could get a refund for the meal that would make me want to order from them again but until the management realizes how rude they were I would not come back here.",Flor de Mayo Restaurant,2651 Broadway
10973,247,26,Chinese,2,05/20/2018,"Interesting and unique but for food...No. There was nothing really good there except sides for the most part. We were four people and had a good assortment by which to judge. A couple of dishes were fine. Absolutely nothing that would knock your hat off. Or whatever they wear where Peru, China, and Mexico intersect. The owner was a doll though.",Flor de Mayo Restaurant,2651 Broadway

10975,249,26,Chinese,4,05/20/2018,Food is delicious but there's always a long wait so plan ahead,Flor de Mayo Restaurant,2651 Broadway
10976,250,26,Chinese,3,05/20/2019,"So because the food at this place is really good and fresh, I have given this restaurant 3 stars. The restaurant has a bit of a tight entrance and narrow seating arrangements. The tables, chairs, and booths can definitely use an upgrade. They have remained the same for at least 10 years. The restaurant is in dire need of an internal renovation. One that can maximize its space and improve its seating arrangements, as well as the internal facade. A lot of things that should not be visible are, making it a bit of an eyesore. If the person seating behind you in a booth moves, you feel it on your end.  The service is adequate and prompt. The people working here are for the most part very attentive. As I stated, the food is really good. But one cannot solely rely on it's menu for attracting, creating, and maintaining their clientele. The place must be well rounded.  The prices are double what you would pay at a place where you would find the same dish. The alcohol drinks are highly priced as well. For God's sake, a small 10oz coffee that would tipically cost $1.25 anywhere else, cost $4.00 + tax here. Absurd!  If they were to upgrade the restaurants decor and furniture, as well as perform improvements for more adequate functionality, they could perhaps try to justify their prices. For me, the place has a special meaning, so I tend to go from time to time, but man, it does not get any better with time. Hopefully this can be addressed. They do not accept Amex. ",Flor de Mayo Restaurant,2651 Broadway
10977,251,26,Chinese,4,05/20/2019,"Great place to eat, ive been a long time patron since 1999. Food is always delicious and good drinks. The only reason i don't give them 5 stars is because the restaurant is small with limited seating. If you go for dinner on a saturday night be prepared to wait 30mins for a table, if your single eating alone they have limited areas were they seat a lone person having dinner and your wait for a table will be 45mins. You would think they would have addressed this after all these years but i guess they figure the more people in your party the better for them so youll definetly be seated quicker.",Flor de Mayo Restaurant,2651 Broadway
10978,252,26,Chinese,5,05/19/2020,Best chino latino restaurant in the city. From the drinks to the food. Tastes great. No complaints. Will say on the weekends it tends to get packed.

Wonton soup was watery,small with waterlogged dumplings; they also provide a very shallow spoon to hide how pathetic the serving size really is! The beef chow fun magically turned into beef fried rice which I certainly did not order; the server and another worker insisted that in chinese-peruvian cooking that chowfun means fried rice!!! A huge lie that is an insult to any intelligent person but they seem to think because I am blind i will believe anything. The pitiful soup was $5 and the beef fried rice had very little beef and tasted heavily of MSG was $12.75!

The decor was beautiful and seating was nice as well.,Chun Bo Restaurant,66 Sparta Ave
13305,7,34,Chinese,3,10/21/2022,"Last night was our first time back since the dining room reopened. After staying loyal through most of the pandemic, as the quality of food continued to decline, we decided to give what used to be a decent Chinese restaurant another shot (in case being served fresh was going to make a difference). I'm disappointed to report that it makes a difference, but not a big one.  First, the good: Service was attentive and cheerful! Hot and sour soup was quite good (not too much vinegar). Fried dumplings were pretty good (skins not too thick, doughy, or heavy).  Now, the not-so-good: Our main courses were very disappointing. Crispy orange beef (which is no longer served with broccoli) was NOT crispy at all (surprising, as hopefully served fresh??), the sauce tasting too salty and possibly burnt. Duck Human Style was badly overcooked, dry and too salty, same problem with the sauce.  Even the dining room is not the same post-reopening. Where are the linens? Why are those ""things"" on the chairs? :(  We have been coming to Chun Bo since it opened and used to enjoy it very much. During the pandemic, we decided to make allowances. It may be time to say, that we have had our last dinner at Chun Bo. We will miss the nice place it once was: the tasty food, the lovely dining room and fresh linens.",Chun Bo Restaurant,66 Sparta Ave

13307,9,34,Chinese,1,01/19/2023,"My first and only visit was today,Christmas day 2022, with a to-go phone order. Having never been here before I asked about the spring rolls (traditionally made with veg only, specifically the veg that is available in the spring) asking if they contained any shellfish, as I am deathly allergic. With confidence the order was taken. Waited a few minutes after quoted time, not a big deal at all, especially being Christmas day. Now as I have had this happen before at other Chinese eateries I had cracked the spring roll in half first, and only saw shredded veggies, assuming it was safe to eat I continued.....big mistake. About 2 bites into the spring roll I see a half bitten piece of 61/70 shrimp. I called to confirm that the spring rolls were intended to have shrimp, when I confronted the person on the phone with this information they became very withdrawn from any responsibility. I wasn't calling to complain, I was calling to make sure that it was a known quantity so others can avoid the same issue. Having a major deadly allergen unannounced, and readily found in a menu item is a dangerous game to play, especially when the customer specifically asks about its contents. This isn't a situation where I ordered something clearly unsafe for my allergy, or I asked for a special modification to an existing menu item. I asked about an item on the menu, was told it DID NOT include the allergen, so naturally when biting into the item and finding a piece of shrimp has now found its way into my digestive system I am.....upset. imagine for a moment that you had a very long last few days between you and your wife/husband, and just wanted to spend Christmas day chilling on the couch while binge watching something on a streaming service while you got a fire going and dogs huddled around you while you snack on some Chinese food. now imagine that entire day gets thrown out the window as you angrily write this review while you're on your way to the emergency room to get pumped full of benadryl so you don't die from anaphylaxis......merry Christmas.    ps. For context I've been an executive chef for over 14 years, hence why I'm soooo tired from the last few days,and really didnt feel like cooking anything today. I can tell you with the upmost of confidence that I wouldn't bother writing a negative review if the food simply sucked (it was meh, but w/e) this is literally a matter of life and death for some people. If you cannot manage an allergen as serious as shellfish than you should strongly reconsider if your business model is viable in 2022. You will have someones life in your hands that has less awareness as I did in this situation, and I can only hope they are lucky enough to make it out alive instead of dying a painful and confusing death from lack of oxygen.",Chun Bo Restaurant,66 Sparta Ave

13312,14,34,Chinese,3,11/20/2022,This place has solid food but something happened 3-4 months ago where any of their food marked as spicy no longer comes as spicy. I typically order their General Taos and Orange flavor chicken which originally came spicy and full of flavor and all of sudden it seemed like the recipe changed.  When I order now I have to ask for it to be extra spicy just so it has some of its heat and original flavor. Not looking to burn out my mouth but would like the dishes to return what they were. Don't know if they got a new chef or changed up something in the back but I hope the management tries some of their dishes and see it is not the same as before.    ***Update***  Have tried them multiple times throughout the last 2 years and it is not like it was pre pandemic. The sauces/seasoning have changed and not for the better. It's not bad food but I used to want to go here almost daily but now it maybe once every couple months to see if they changed back.,Chun Bo Restaurant,66 Sparta Ave

I've gone many times when I was younger and still take a trip once in a while to go here. Although I had a bad experience a couple times with someone on staff who waited our table. But overall, great!    Review from 2023: Falling from grace. No egg in the fried rice anymore, no more leechee nuts on the dessert menu. 3.5/5",Chun Bo Restaurant,66 Sparta Ave

The food is average Chinese, the pricing is slightly higher, and the sushi feels mildly like a backdoor secret when it's available.  They undertake a pretty traditional set or sushi offerings, however, the flavors are often ""a little off"" as are the textures and colors.

So on top of the price increases, I'm now being charged on how I give this business my money    I frequent this restaurant probably 2-3 times a week. I don't really carry cash regularly so I guess i won't be visiting so frequently.    I'd rather see another price increase across the board, rather than be charged .50 cents.

I ordered general tso  shrimp not spicy  as I always have with the chicken. It came out with at least 7 hot peppers on the dish. First bite I knew it was too spicy for me I told waitress it was too spicy for me she replied after taking a spoon and stirring around hot peppers  it’s not too spicy. I didn’t want to feel like a complainer so I didn’t push the issue. The waitress also had the whole room and never came back to remove any plates. She never brought us water after 2 request poor service and not a helpful waitress. I suffered a headache and heart burn all night. Very disappointed.

What I liked most was the environment and dinning experience had a authentic feel. The exterior is deceiving, inside is a surprisingly authentic, upscale Asian restaurant. I will definitely return with the hubby for a date night. One thing I didn't like was that some of the wait staff was a little to ""serious "" they could be more lively and welcoming.  There was one waiter whom was totally different, I think he may have been new. He was great with serving the kids, although he didn't speak alot of English you could tell he was trying very hard.

She made us wait for what seemed like no reason while she prepared drinks for other guests and then finally came back to us about 5 minutes later to seat us. Thankfully our waiter was incredibly friendly (think the uncle you wish you had around on Christmas to dote gifts on you). Yep, he was that awesome. And the food was good! Reasonably priced too.

We understood and it was okay but that was when it became uncomfortable. We automatically caught a huge attitude from the waiter. We were hungry but not starving so we planned on sharing a combo and an appetizer. The waiter was extremely rude and when he realized that all we wanted to do was share a combo he got even nastier. He told us that there was no way it would be enough food for the two of us. He walked away and never even asked us if we wanted a drink. He was nasty every time he came to the table to bring us things after we ordered. We finally got to order a drink but it took till almost when we were done eating for him to bring it. He never brought soy sauce to the table I had to get up and get it. We said thank you and were very nice to him every single time he came to the table to try and lighten the mood, letting him know how good the food was multiple times but he continued to be nasty. As we where standing up to put on our jackets he reached around us to grab the check off the table instead of waiting for us to move away from the table almost bumping my boyfriend to get it, obviously to see what kind of a tip we left, which was 25% and he just stormed away like we were just in his way.  Food is great here no doubt but the service was completely uncomfortable and severely poor!!!  Hopefully next visit we will have a better experience cause like I said the food was very good and it was a nice atmosphere.

This place is in the middle - better than average and good quality. I've only eaten in twice, but ordered take out a dozen times in the past 5 years and never had a problem, they're always polite. The two times I ate in, they were friendly. One time the food came a bit slowly, but if you're in good company, you can sit and shoot the breeze, which is what we did. I've always enjoyed the food, which is tasty. It's the best Chinese food for miles around, I won't eat at any of the other places, and now that we moved to PA, I still won't. For Chinese food in this area, to me it's either Chun Bo's or else it's not worth eating - I learned that the hard way - a few places we tried were no good, not even to satisfy a craving for cheap Chinese food - I'm not TOO picky but I don't enjoy poor quality, greasy food cooked in rancid oil.

13367,71,34,Chinese,1,05/22/2010,"I have eaten here many times, but after my last experience, will never go back.  I was shocked at how we were treated by the manager/owner.  We had made reservations for New Years Eve.  When we arrived, we were told it would be 10 minutes.  10 minutes later, we were told 10 to 15 more minutes.  Others with reservations appeared to be having the same experience.  Obviously, the fact that we made reservations earlier in the day meant nothing.  After waiting as long as we could (we had two toddlers who could not wait any longer to eat) we left, obviously never having been seated.  On the way out, I mentioned to the owner/manager that the next time they take a reservation, they should honor the reservation as well.  His response: ""The next time you call to make reservations, if I know it is you, I won't accept it.""  Wow - definitely something you should never say to a customer.  Needless to say we won't be coming here again, and I suggest you avoid this place as well.  Not worth your money or time.",Chun Bo Restaurant,66 Sparta Ave

13373,77,34,Chinese,4,05/20/2019,Old school Chinese restaurant (also has a sushi bar). Very reasonably priced food and drinks. Could have been 5 stars except tired decor (some of the seats needed reupholstering) and my wife was served what seemed to be Moscato although she ordered Pinot grigio. We will be back.,Chun Bo Restaurant,66 Sparta Ave
13374,78,34,Chinese,5,05/20/2018,"A nice Chinese place for a sit-down with a white, linen tablecloth.    But, the thing that I love about this place is the cocktail menu. It's a real classic from the 1950s filled with odd ball concoctions like the Zombie and the Pink Squirrel.    They waitress doesn't even blink when I order these weird things. And, although it can take a while for them to figure it out and deliver the goods, they always do.    You might want to order a beer while you wait for your drink.    Over the course of a couple of years, I've worked my way through half of the cocktail menu, and look forward to sampling all of them.    Recommended: The Flaming Volcano Bowl for Two.",Chun Bo Restaurant,66 Sparta Ave

13376,80,34,Chinese,1,05/20/2019,"Sushi/food was very good...BUT server was HORRIBLE. Couldn't take our orders all at once...kept leaving WHILE he was taking our order and didn't even ask what drinks we would like.  Then had the AUDACITY to complain about his tip TO US as we we're leaving.  Exact words "" REALLY? only a  ___ amount tip??? And shook his head)  Maybe if you were respectful and did your job right and was respectful it would have been more...  One of the worst waiting experiences I've ever had and I've worked in the reausruant buissness for 6 years and NEVER in my life have i ever came across a waiter this rude and impolite.  Never will dine inside again.",Chun Bo Restaurant,66 Sparta Ave
13377,81,34,Chinese,4,05/20/2019,Found our selves in Newton at lunchtime. Looked at local guides and selected Chun Bo for lunch. Saw Peking Duck on the menu for two...it was delicious. The duck was crispy and the pancakes were fresh. I highly recommend this restaurant and this lunch.,Chun Bo Restaurant,66 Sparta Ave
13378,82,34,Chinese,2,05/20/2019,"Probably a downhill slope of putting Chun  Bo at the bottom of  the 4 Chinese restaurants we have in Newton. Great ambiance, well almost, as repairs seem neglected. So what’s my take? I ordered Roast Pork egg foo young for lunch. There was little seasoning in the egg foo young and gravy but my lips are still chapped from either msg or cheap salty soy sauce. But all is not bad because I can still taste the burned part of the egg pancake which was left to sizzle in the wok to long. Here I thought only the happy wok burned egg foo young ",Chun Bo Restaurant,66 Sparta Ave
13379,83,34,Chinese,1,05/19/2020,"They got my order wrong and then argued with me about what I said! Extremely rude in customer service and I think I know what I wanted to eat thank you!

13381,85,34,Chinese,3,05/20/2017,"This is an okay Chinese restaurant.  I can't say it's ""good"", and calling it ""bad"" would be too harsh.  It's just okay.    Their hot and sour soup is bad.  And a hot and sour soup is the number one item that I use to judge the quality of a Chinese restaurant.    Everything I've tried here (and I've tried a lot) is mediocre.    ""Wow, this is interesting"" is something I've never said while tasting any dish from Chun Bo.    I don't have a good alternate recommendation for you.  I don't think good Chinese food exists anywhere in Sussex County.   I just wish these guys tried harder.",Chun Bo Restaurant,66 Sparta Ave
13382,86,34,Chinese,1,05/19/2020,Absolutely horrible! I ordered General Toas chicken.  It came with broccoli.  The broccoli was sour and the chicken was over cooked.

16498,0,47,Chinese,2,07/23/2022,"I always enjoy Dim Sum II in Cranford whenever we ate at the restaurant pre-COVID. they are pricier than the other Chinese restaurants in town and it’s usually worth it. I ordered Lo mein, General tso’s, and wonton soup a few months ago and it was fine. Today I ordered pad thai and oh my!  The Regular Pad Thai and is so very bad and I don’t ever remember anything this bad from Dim Sum II. It’s over, over-cooked noodles that are so soft they’re almost mushed together and dry, the sauce taste like sweetened ketchup, the shrimp tastes frozen, and the chicken is bland but their is some oil added for flavor? I am nauseous and grossed out after trying a few bites. I picked out the chicken for my Capt. Jack (Jack-Chi) then I threw the rest away. It’s inedible.  I also got a shrimp eggroll which again I can’t believe how bad the egg roll is. It’s literally an undercooked egg roll wrapper (not fried enough) with raw undercooked cabbage andwith 3 little shrimp. It’s gross and I can’t eat it. Now I’m really nauseous.  I also got short ribs (rib tips) with black bean sauce for $8.95 and it’s 1/2 of a small (pint) soup container with little chopped up pieces of rib tips, green peppers, red peppers and a brown gravy that is not black bean sauce. It’s hard to eat because you have to pick out the cartilage and bone and all your taste is green peppers. I know rib tips have cartilage and bone but I hoped for the bigger pieces so you don’t have to worry about the tiny pieces of bone. I took a few bites but it’s not at all black bean sauce and all I taste is peppers.  What happened DIM SUM II Cranford? I don’t understand why it’s so bad.  I will try DIM SUM II again maybe…. But only if I eat at the restaurant. I’ll never order Pad Thai, shrimp rolls or rib tips here again.",Dim Sum II Chinese Restaurant,17 Eastman St
16499,1,47,Chinese,1,06/23/2022,"I ordered patthai I ask them to make it not spicy and they made it spicy I Oredered dumplings and didn't get the sauce, I ask light sauce felt want really light, so couldn't enjoy my food and neither my kids, for the price we are very disappointed.",Dim Sum II Chinese Restaurant,17 Eastman St
16500,2,47,Chinese,5,04/19/2023,"Recommendation from neighbors did not disappoint...My new ""go to"" for fresh and flavorful food, served by friendly and accommodating food professionals, and proprietors.    See you soon Dim Sum II!",Dim Sum II Chinese Restaurant,17 Eastman St
16501,3,47,Chinese,5,05/05/2023,I cannot tell you how delicious their food is and the dumplings are to die for. Always consistent. Wished they would honor Uber.,Dim Sum II Chinese Restaurant,17 Eastman St

16503,5,47,Chinese,5,05/19/2022,Gluten free  Wow very very good we picked it up and was ready when we got their. I'm super sensitive and this was perfect if you have allergies. I Was in the area. General TSO chicken. Did not hurt our belly. I have Celiac's. I will definitely be coming back,Dim Sum II Chinese Restaurant,17 Eastman St
16504,6,47,Chinese,1,11/20/2022,The owner has no respect for it's customers . I called back to add smthg to my order and he started screaming at me into the phone  so I cancelled my order .won't b ordering from there any more.         A zillion other Chinese  places near by . Learn some manners !!!   Most expensive Chinese in town too.  .,Dim Sum II Chinese Restaurant,17 Eastman St
16505,7,47,Chinese,2,09/21/2022,"Usually pretty decent but my last order was completely wrong. Ordered chicken chow mein but they left out the chicken. Also ordered beef fried rice but they gave me chicken fried rice. For the prices they should really do a better job making sure orders are correct, especially for just one person.",Dim Sum II Chinese Restaurant,17 Eastman St
16506,8,47,Chinese,1,05/19/2022,Ordered several combination platters last night for dinner. 2 of the meals were general tsaos and it was absolutely disgusting. As you stabbed at the chicken with your fork to take a piece the batter would literally come off of the chicken and stay stuck to the piece in the container. The chicken was super underdone. Also got fried wontons that seem to have been fried hours prior. There was absolutely no crunch - it was like biting into styrofoam. Very disappointed.,Dim Sum II Chinese Restaurant,17 Eastman St
16507,9,47,Chinese,5,05/19/2021,"My all-time favorite place! I am so thankful to have found it. As someone with celiac, I haven't been able to have good gluten-free Chinese food in years. I'm usually stuck to ordering the few dishes that don't have soy sauce, and that quickly gets boring. At Dim Sum II, with their gluten free menu, there are SO many delicious gluten free options that I often have trouble deciding what to order... a pleasant ""problem"" that I am not used to having! I have a very sensitive stomach in addition to my food allergies, and this is one of the only restaurants that I always feel 100% safe eating at. Plus, the staff is always so friendly and wonderful. What a gem of a place!  I'd like to add also, because I notice a lot of people are saying it is expensive... the portions are HUGE. Every time I eat here, I get at least 2 if not 3 meals out of each dish. So while the prices may look high, you have to keep in mind you're going to have 2-3 more meals worth of leftovers.",Dim Sum II Chinese Restaurant,17 Eastman St
16508,10,47,Chinese,2,05/19/2022,"Okay... This 1 is hard because of the pandemic. We've been coming here for years. I called on Saturday 5pm for a pickup and I could tell they were crushed. I gave my simple 3 item order. It was repeated back to me. My phone number was taken, twice. Told 30 minutes. Get there and see about 6 bags for pickup. Give my number. Multiple looks and no order. Was asked when I ordered and said I got off the phone with you 30 minutes ago. I was asked if I wanted to reorder. I declined. I'll try again if and when there's more help in the front end. I'm sure they are understaffed and swamped because of the orders on the table to go.",Dim Sum II Chinese Restaurant,17 Eastman St
16509,11,47,Chinese,5,05/19/2022,"If you have allergies, they're really great at handling them.

And they use vegetable oil!",Dim Sum II Chinese Restaurant,17 Eastman St
16510,12,47,Chinese,1,08/22/2022,"Update: I thought to myself to give them another try. The woman who answers the phone is an absolute bi*ch, and would not reveal her name. She has absolutely no customer service skills. She discrimates, and is just a horrible human being..  She is rude, condescending, and dismissive. DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR BUSINESS.    She Food is decent, but the woman who answers can sure check her horrible attitude at the door, as I won't be ordering from them ever again. She is so rude, and not thankful whatsoever. She hems and haws, sighs, has this monotonous tone/could care less demeanor, and just irks the hell out of me. Service is equally important as quality of food.",Dim Sum II Chinese Restaurant,17 Eastman St

16512,14,47,Chinese,4,05/19/2022,"I recommend the Young Chow Fried rice, beef chow mein, and roast duck. My husband really liked the siu mai, crystal shrimp dumplings, and sesame balls. It was better than I expected from a Chinese restaurant outside of Chinatown. It hit the spot for someone that wants Chinese food but doesn't want to travel to Chinatown to get it. I would also recommend staying away from the seafood items because they don't do seafood very well here. Everything else is pretty good.",Dim Sum II Chinese Restaurant,17 Eastman St

16515,17,47,Chinese,5,05/19/2020,Gluten free menu is pretty extensive. I had chicken and broccoli and it was delicious!  I highly recommend.    My portion was big enough for three meals. Excellent service with reasonable prices.,Dim Sum II Chinese Restaurant,17 Eastman St
16516,18,47,Chinese,5,01/19/2023,"This is the best Chinese food take out in the area, no place is better.",Dim Sum II Chinese Restaurant,17 Eastman St
16517,19,47,Chinese,3,05/19/2021,"The food is fine, but way overpriced for what you receive, and overpriced in comparison to other Chinese restaurants in the area. On no less than 4 occasions, ordering the General Tso's Chicken has been a scavenger hunt to find the meat. It's basically a sauced dough with some bits of meat here and there. So, while the pieces look generously large, not every single piece contains chicken, which is obviously disappointing for a chicken dish. I even ordered it more than once, just to be fair and rule out a bad night or a bad batch. Then, when you ask how much the total is over the phone, there is an exasperated sigh, as if you're somehow wasting their time ordering from them. If you're charging someone's card, it's not out of line for that person to ask how much will be charged. The reason I gave 3 stars instead of only 2 is because the Crispy Shrimp & Scallops with Walnuts is not a dish I have found easily at other restaurants. However, the crispy cellophane noodles side should be replaced with something heartier, especially for the price they charge.",Dim Sum II Chinese Restaurant,17 Eastman St
16518,20,47,Chinese,5,05/19/2021,"Only ever gotten take out, but its great Chinese food for the area! Dumplings are good, and they do the classic dishes well. Heed this warning and don't go adventurous on dish choice cuse they miss the mark more often than not (every time in my experiance).",Dim Sum II Chinese Restaurant,17 Eastman St
16519,21,47,Chinese,1,05/19/2021,Terrible food. Dumplings had a greyish color to them and were tasteless.  Same with the wings and  Pork fried rice.  Pad thai was awful.  Only decent thing was the pork egg roll.  We could not finish even half our meals.,Dim Sum II Chinese Restaurant,17 Eastman St
16520,22,47,Chinese,4,05/19/2020,"Four stars only because it is kind of expensive for Chinese food.  However the Gluten free options are amazing, (again very expensive) but sooooo worth it.  They could add more meat to the combo meals for the price of it.  But over all amazing food.    Always keeps me coming back..",Dim Sum II Chinese Restaurant,17 Eastman St
16521,23,47,Chinese,4,05/19/2020,"The food was excellent . This this is my new go-to Chinese restaurant. My husband and I have been searching for a new one since the one we used to like when out of business. The service inside the restaurant was very pleasant. I gave four stars only because the air conditioning in the restaurant isn't the greatest but at least I know I can always have it delivered. I had the edamamaas an appetizer, general tso chicken it came with white rice, or you can get fried rice. But I was in the mood for noodles so I got a side of chicken lo mein. And I tried my daughter's tofu, general tso. I'm not a big fan of tofu but to my surprise it was delicious as well.",Dim Sum II Chinese Restaurant,17 Eastman St
16522,24,47,Chinese,1,05/19/2022,"Do not order online from here. Your order will not be correct, will take over an hour, and you will over-pay for sides. The food quality has also diminished tremendously over the years.",Dim Sum II Chinese Restaurant,17 Eastman St
16523,25,47,Chinese,1,05/19/2021,You might enjoy your food.. if you ever receive it. Waited 1.5 hours for delivery to receive a messed up order. Called the restaurant to fix the order/ pick up the missing meals and was told that the missing items would be ready in another 30 minutes. Multiple orders came out before ours when we originally ordered over 2 hours ago. Very disappointed.,Dim Sum II Chinese Restaurant,17 Eastman St
16524,26,47,Chinese,1,05/19/2021,"Don’t bother ordering from Dim Sum 2.  You’ll never get your food.  We waited well over 1.5 hours, after we were told it would be ready in a hour.  Called when we got there told it would be another 10 mins and then were hung up on.  Called back still wasn’t ready, finally told them we didn’t want it because the woman that answers the phone was just downright nasty every time we called.  We are trying to support Small local businesses but don’t need to deal with businesses like this.  Would give them 0 stars if possible.  We wish One Walnut had been open.",Dim Sum II Chinese Restaurant,17 Eastman St

16527,29,47,Chinese,5,05/20/2019,Been eating there for almost 20 years never had a bad meal. The family that owns it are very hard working and always make customers feel welcome. Cranford is lucky to have such a wonderful family restaurant,Dim Sum II Chinese Restaurant,17 Eastman St
16528,30,47,Chinese,1,05/19/2020,"I did not feel welcomed here. I was still finishing my entre and the waiter gave me my bill before I finished! He also said make sure you sign the receipt. I was a little taken back by it, what if I wanted dessert? I'm latino and I was wearing a hat and dressed down but I am actually a food blogger and sad to say this will be my first ever bad review by #chinoeats . Maybe they don't like spanish people that dress down? Regardless no one should be treated like I was. It's unfortunate because I had been wanting to come here for some time. The food was mediocre to say the least, the pork buns had no meat in it, the entre was scorching hot and dry. It killed my mood and pretty demoralized after that experience.",Dim Sum II Chinese Restaurant,17 Eastman St
16529,31,47,Chinese,2,05/20/2019,"Usually okay, but they messed up my delivery order giving me a 2/3 portion and forgetting the sauce (and there was no soy sauce or hot sauce provided either) - making the meal super-bland.  Wasn't able to reach them the same day (no one picked up and then was after close).    When I called them the next day to inform them, the person who picked up couldn't help and handed it to presumably the owner who offered to make the sauce for me to pick up (not deliver it).  She was nice, but sauce the following day is not very useful.  Then I hear the original person who picked up the phone in the background saying, ""why are you on the phone still, just hang up!""  So that pretty much ended the conversation.    Not the best customer service.",Dim Sum II Chinese Restaurant,17 Eastman St
16530,32,47,Chinese,1,05/20/2019,Took an hour to get our food. Told them my girlfriend was allergic to mushroom and asked if the seafood and shrimp dumplings had mushroom and they just said I don't know. Didn't go find out just said idk. Then we ordered our entree and said no mushroom. They cooked it with mushroom then tried to take out the pieces afterwards. Luckily they missed a piece or else my gf would have had an allergic reaction. Terrible service and dangerously tried to serve us mushroom.,Dim Sum II Chinese Restaurant,17 Eastman St

Food overall was 3.5/5 (chicken with cashew nuts, house lo-me n, hot and sour soup). Good but nothing to write home about/nothing that’d make me crave coming back for.",Supreme Restaurant,100 Mott St
28082,1,91,Chinese,5,07/29/2022,"Stopped by this restaurant twice in the last year when friends were visiting, and each time was delicious! I thought the soup dumplings were amazing, but I hadn’t eaten pork in awhile so it was extra flavorful to me. Service was attentive both times, and inside their covered street patio they have plugs which is great if you’re out and about and need a quick charge. I love the thick Shanghai noodles that I’m pretty sure come with the lo mien (or we asked for them). As others have said, they don’t take credit but will take debit. An amazing meal that’s very affordable!",Supreme Restaurant,100 Mott St
28083,2,91,Chinese,5,03/26/2023,"Highly recommend this restaurant. When we walked in even a little late dinner hour, there was still a waiting line. And we saw most of the customers were Chinese or Asian. We knew it’s the right place to come. The menu was pretty good. Almost everything you need. And not the whole pages of the junky American Chinese food. So we chose to have some dumplings, veggies, spicy meat and soup. The original plan was to order two meat dishes but the waitress stopped us and advised their food size was aggressively big. And we found out what she said was right. We barely finished the food. All of the food was super delicious! Very satisfying!!! If you are like us wanting more food, starving yourselves a couple of hours or a half day first.",Supreme Restaurant,100 Mott St
28084,3,91,Chinese,2,01/25/2023,"We ordered pork soup dumplings which is good, vegetable soup doesn’t have taste, Crispy Peking duck which is a little salty but still good and house fried rice which i would recommend  just the right taste.Soup spoon was not clean we had to ask for a new one from the lady at the counter.    The lady at the counter was nice and always smiling. But the guy server was not talking at all just waiting for us to give orders. When we bill out the server DEMANDED a tip. We gave tip but i guess he was not happy. He did not even appreciate it.Well we are not happy with his service either tip is not something to be demanded it is given when you have a good customer service but he did not have at all.",Supreme Restaurant,100 Mott St
28085,4,91,Chinese,4,05/25/2022,"Wonderful Shanghai restaurant for a reasonable price! I went with two friends and prices are very reasonable. The dumplings had a lot of soup and aren't the best, but they hit the spot. We also had the red bean pancakes, pan fried cakes, Shanghai rice cakes and cold beef. All of them were great! A weird quirk was that they don't take credit card but do take debt cards.",Supreme Restaurant,100 Mott St

The restaurant are clean and the service is excellent with polite servers ( which is different from another dim sum place) There food that we tried were so good and fresh,  - soup dumpling with pork  - hot and sour soup  - wonton sichaun style  - shrimp dumpling  - Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce.

28092,12,91,Chinese,5,05/25/2022,"The food was really good. The soup dumplings have to be my favorite as they are the perfect remedy for the growing chilly weather. The scallion pancake was good with the sauce and the pork buns were warm and sweet. The service was pretty good as well. Just a good note is they don't take credit, but debit so either have cash or debit prepared.",Supreme Restaurant,100 Mott St
28093,13,91,Chinese,4,12/26/2022,"We came here for dinner and the service was really attentive.    What we got: Wonton soup, Scallion Pancake with aromatic beef, Sweet sour fish and Pork Soup Dumplings.    Who to bring: The menu selection was really simple dishes and small portioned, not a place for large gatherings and that I can bring my family to for a 9-course dinner.  Ideal for parties of 4 or less for a casual dinner.    Vibes: The ambiance had a cheesy DIY vibe with multicolored neon lights ceiling mounted beneath translucent plastic screens, Chinese porcelain figurines on a shelf loaded with dollar bills.  A glass shelf fronting the stairs to the bathroom with more porcelain figurines. There was no background music playing, but it felt like a karaoke bar with the neon lights.  Along a wall, the wooden booth seating was constantly filled for the hour we dined there.  On a long ledge sat scantly placed vases of tiny indoor plants at each booth.  A single wall where we sat had an asian-influenced wall paper that was adhered to the wall with strips of clear packing tape.  The ambiance was definitely a highlight, mainly to wonder where the inspiration was drawn from and what kind of creative team designed and executed this interior?    Food: The Wonton soup was made of white shanghai wrappers, and I am used to the hong kong style wontons that are yellow from containing egg in the wrapper. But the soup was possibly literally warm steamy water and some broth powder in a dull red, over-scoured plastic bowl; not the kind of plating that reads appetizing and enticing.    Scallion pancake with aromatic beef: The paper menu did not have any photos ordering dishes came as a guess. The pancake was crispy and deliciously filled with julienned cucumbers and tender braised aromatic beef.  My guess to aromatic means five-spice, sugar and soy sauce.    Sweet sour fish was delicious.  The battered fish, crispy while smothered in sauce.    Rice. While even simple plain white rice can be bad sometimes, this place served well steamed rice in bowls that was nicely mounded on the top and perfectly sticky enough to hold on the chopstick; fragrant enough to know it wasn't that cheap rice that some restaurants, within walking distance, would bury in the bottom of your dish.    Service: The neighboring tables ordered different dishes to my interest, particularly a dish with three stuffed beef meatballs the size of a fist for $21 and change.  The waitress, when I asked her about the price, went to look it up and hollered the price to me 10 feet away, followed with asking if I wanted to order it.  I really appreciate the sense of homeliness this waitress brought, just like talking to my mother-in-law.    Overall the experience was great. Make sure to dine with good company so you can thoroughly enjoy Supreme.",Supreme Restaurant,100 Mott St

28098,18,91,Chinese,5,05/25/2022,I enjoyed the tasty Shanghai Dim Sum in this restaurant.  It wasn’t crowded in the late afternoon.  The food was served hot and prompt.  Be careful with hot soup coming out from either Xiao Long Bao or  fried pork bun when you take a bite.,Supreme Restaurant,100 Mott St
28099,20,91,Chinese,4,10/27/2022,"Best soup dumplings I've found so far in Chinatown (I've only been to a few). The skins are thin and the filling is not fatty. Is it the thinnest like Din Tai Fung (only on the West Coast)? No but, pretty thin. The fried buns were bao-like (bready) with a crisp bottom - it could have used more filling but still yummy. The scallions pancakes were good. Prices are reasonable. Water was served & filled without me asking. We went around 8pm on a Wednesday and there were plenty of tables.    Edit: went back again, this time to try a few more items, such as Szechuan dumplings (spicy sesame sauce). Boiled pork dumplings. These were ok but will not be ordering again.",Supreme Restaurant,100 Mott St

We then gave him our card to pay and said he doesn't except credit cards only debit cards. We paid in cash and he demand a tip We refused because of poor service. Consequently the only tip he received was to learn some customer and people skills. The food was overall average, I definitely won't be repeating the experience.

28108,29,91,Chinese,4,05/25/2021,"Pretty good Chinese. Had the crab and pork soup dumplings (good though I think I might prefer soup dumplings without the crab and just with pork) and the rice cake with preserved cabbage and shredded pork (an interesting dish; not sure I love rice cakes as a food in general, but I would order them once in a while for the novelty).",Supreme Restaurant,100 Mott St

Table ordered: egg drop soup, wonton soup, fried wonton, kung pow chicken and I believe the beef and broccoli     My friend said everything was great. But I did feel everything was a bit salty. I was not a fan of the fried wonton, but that's because of the peanut sauce on top. Just wasn't for me.    Overall I experienced China town in NY, but Houston's is much better.",Supreme Restaurant,100 Mott St
28111,32,91,Chinese,5,02/24/2023,"delicious! the eggplant was succulent, the tofu crispy (even if not called as such), and the string beans looked supreme. next time i will be sure to give them a try. one man next to us looked like andrew garfield, so it's a bit of a who's who.",Supreme Restaurant,100 Mott St
28112,33,91,Chinese,5,02/24/2023,"No need to wait long at other touristy spots in Chinatown! My Shanghainese friends tell me this is where they go to, instead of Joe's Shanghai and others. The food here is so reasonably priced and delicious! I highly recommend going with a bigger group to try out a bunch of different things, since seating usually isn't an issue here. My favorite are the xiao long baos, scallion pancakes (sooo flaky and amazing; might be my favorite in the entire Chinatown), shrimp dumplings, and pan fried noodles (also done amaingly; other restaurants' don't compare imo). Pretty much everything will be good and safe option. Bonus points that the restaurant takes cards!",Supreme Restaurant,100 Mott St
28113,34,91,Chinese,1,05/26/2018,"10.29.17 - okay, I started eating here when the restaurant was located at 59 Mott. It's been a few years since I've eaten at the current location and I recognize some of the original staff, but this restaurant is generally terrible.    The soup dumplings are okay, but nothing like it used to be. The salt & pepper pork is over cooked, dry, and flavorless; the Shanghai Fried Rice has become a joke; The bean curd and soy beans with preserved vegetables is sloppy. Honestly, it's hard to believe that this place has a strong following.    The restaurant itself needs a facelift and it looks like the floors have not been mopped in weeks.    The service is still friendly and attentive, but the kitchen is a mess (figuratively)    Lastly, it's cash only, which would be fine if the food was worth it, but it's not. I've been so shocked with this experience that I'm compelled to revisit all the soup dumpling shops in NYC.",Supreme Restaurant,100 Mott St
28114,35,91,Chinese,4,05/25/2020,"This restaurant is a new reincarnation of Shanghai Cafe. The soup dumplings are the smaller variety, and they were pretty good, less greasy than Joe's but also less filled with soup. Overall not bad! We also got the salt and pepper fried prawns and stir fried rice cakes, which were also yummy! Also the staff here is extremely friendly, which is honestly a bit odd for Chinatown....",Supreme Restaurant,100 Mott St
28115,36,91,Chinese,5,05/25/2020,"My wife and I visited this excellent small  restaurant few days ago.  We used to come to this location a lot (about 10 years ago) while we lived in Chinatown.  They used to have another name.  Then later they change the name (and maybe the owner too) few years ago.This is the first time we came back since they changed their name. (We have moved out of Chinatown for a while).  We found that their taste have changed a bit.  It's better and close to the taste we had in Shanghai.    We ordered their flagship dish SIU LOONG BAO( STEAMED TINY SOUP DUMPLINGS) is pretty close to the ones I had in Shanghai.  The Dumpling really have a lot of tasty juices or soup inside, but the wrap or skin outside still nice and chewy.  One got to have some skill to eat these kind of dumpling, otherwise those soup will all come out to the bowl instead going with the meat inside.  We also had the sour vegetable fried think Shanhainese noodle. Pretty good. Another thing we order is Shanghainese rice cake soup.  The rice cake is pretty chewy.  It's the way we like.  However the soup is different from what we expect.  The traditional Shanghainese soup is white bone broth.  The one they cook is brown soy sauce base soup.  It's different but taste good.    Over all this restaurant is good.  They have  Chief who knows the traditional Shanghai and surrounding area cuisine. The price is very reasonable.  The atmosphere has a lot of neon lighting, but still cozy.  I definately will come back here next time I go to New York Chinatown again.",Supreme Restaurant,100 Mott St
28116,37,91,Chinese,3,05/25/2020,"Shanghai Dumpling is in chinatown of Manhattan. It is a small restaurant with purple lighting inside. The servers were fast, felt a bit rushed when ordering. As soon as we sat down they gave us water, came back in 2 minutes to see if we knew what we wanted to order (good thing we knew we wanted to eat soup dumplings). My bf and I ordered the pork soup dumplings and the crab and pork soup dumplings. It is nice they use real crab meat but I cannot really taste the crab. I thought the original pork soup dumplings were more flavorful. The skin was perfectly thin, but the soup was a little greasy. Each order had 8 dumplings (in my photo I took one on my plate beforehand). It is important to note that this place accept cash only, they have an atm machine if you forget.",Supreme Restaurant,100 Mott St

Their Xiao Long Baos (dumplings) are not as good as Joe's Shanghai, but their rice cakes (nian gao) are awesome. Their veggies are also delicious. The jellyfish is decent - not the best I've had, but not the worst either.    I would AVOID their scallion pancakes. It felt pre-purchased frozen and just heated up. It was also insanely oily.    CASH only also. What I really did not like was that they would not give you a receipt! If you need to expense anything, you need to take a picture of the receipt and print it out.

Order the pork soup dumplings and eggplant dish! Their scallion pancakes and noodles are also decent.    I see reviews about the service here, and yes they can be a bit rude and pushy, but to me, worth it for the quality food and price.

Bill was $27, pulled out card, was told cash only(no signs posted anywhere).(disclaimer, i have been living overseas for years, they dont tip, they pay their workers livable wages, I believe a tip is just that, by definition a voluntary donation for good service, regardless i have been tipping 15-20% while here depending if they do more then the minimum)  Laid down $30, before i could even stand up, waiter came by and said. The tip isnt included, i said keep the change (thinking he met i paid to much). He said the tip isnt included. I said ok. He said The TIP is not INCLUDED! ( very forcefully). i said, yeah.. He said the bill is $27, i said yes. He said you tipped $3 thats 10%... Normally people tip at least 15%!    Now I'm annoyed, i don't believe in people asking for a tip, it's not their choice it's the customers decision what to tip or tip at all.    But i just said, well i don't have any small bills, since you don't take card, and I'm not giving you an other $10. If your not happy with my tip, give me my $3 difference and you won't get any tip.    He walked away. Talked to other Co workers, they all glared and started laughing.

This is honestly better than the ""hyped"" up Joe Shanghai and it is so much cheaper, but of course, the service may be a bit more ""direct"" but aside from that, the food is amazing.    The scallion pancake is very classic and not too oily and quite crispy and just nice. The wine chicken is a cold dish, which isn't for everyone but for me, where we have had it all our lives it was quite nice. The wine chicken doesn't actually taste like wine and it doesn't get you drunk, there is a slight alcohol taste and it's cold and refreshing. We have ordered noodle soups here before and it is quite nice also, simple and to the point and very nice. The stir-fried dishes are also really good, pick the one that you want to try and just go for it.

I also highly recommend the scallion pancakes, and rice cakes.  (I’ve order similar things from other places and everywhere else is trash).  The service here is quick and to the point, and that is perfectly fine by me because that means my food gets to me quicker. Watching the workers is something I also enjoy about this place because you see them working hard. They are a well oiled machine.  I also want to point out that I do not live in the city, but i venture down at least once a month and I always come here.

We were trying to figure out what to get for lunch when we noticed they were back open! Since then I have been back with other friends & have ordered to go a few times!

I had the crab & pork dumplings which were very good, never had them with crab before. I love that you dumpling skins are translucent so you can see the soup you're about to enjoy.    I did not enjoy the scallion pancake we ordered, it was too greasy and doughy, I'd skip those.    I prefer my dumplings just the way they are served, without the vinegar dipping sauce, but most people put some vinegar in their soon to enjoy the dumplings with.    If you've never had a soup dumpling, here is a tip: put the dumping in your soup spoon, bite the top, suck out the soup, then eat the dumpling. mmmmm!    Bonus: Inexpensive!

The place was packed, but they got people coming in seated within a few minutes. It's a decent option, but I think I'd want to try other places rather than running back immediately. The prices are very reasonable, with over rice dishes for $4.50 or so and full entrees for about $10-$15. The soups were pleasantly not crazily inflated.

Vegetable dumplings were bland abed after eating half of one, I decided it wasn't necessary to eat any more of those.  The chicken and pork dumplings were better, with a slight preference for the chicken, but neither were great.  If you're going to come, order the soup dumplings and nothing else.

The food was okay, but at least it was inexpensive. I had the pork steamed dumplings (I'm used to them being called potstickers) and pork fried rice. I scalded my lower lip on the first dumpling.

The coolest thing is that there is a waitress here who remembers us every time we come back!  We can only get up here from Florida once or twice a year, so after all this time and the amount of people going thru this place its pretty nice to be remembered.

I quietly asked the hostess why and she said that it was because they wanted to get give us better seating. There were either tables in the center or booths to seat 4 on each side what better seating? I waited another 5 minutes and decided this is Chinatown plenty of more fine Chinese eateries around here to have to stand for such poor treatment of a place I am only patronizing for quite some time now.

Scallion pancake was just really greasy plain fried bread dough except for a small patch with some scallions.

I’ve been coming here for years, under the name Shanghai Cafe Deluxe, and was devastated when they shut down for renovations. Usually that means they’re actually closed. But thankfully they have re-opened under the new name, Supreme restaurant. I was hesitant to have lunch here, as I have believed the food might be different. The space is usually packed to the gills (2years ago), and it is worryingly empty now. Obviously covid has taken its toll but I also think people are confused about the new name. I’m happy to say it’s the same amazing spot. If you’ve been here before, rest assured it’s still the wonderful little dumpling place you remember.

28227,152,91,Chinese,5,05/26/2016,"How was the ordering experience? I made the mistake of actually looking at the menu, and for a second, I was confused. Art had told me on the menu, they were called pork steamed buns, but everyone calls them soup dumplings. I sputtered my way through my order and tried to figure out which item I was supposed to actually be ordering. In the end, the lady behind the counter knew that I was probably trying to order the pork soup dumplings (I think they are the staple item there), so she just said oh, pork soup dumplings and I nodded gratefully.    How unique is the food? Ok, if you haven’t heard of soup dumplings, you need to try these. They are quickly becoming a popular dish among my friends. These are not dumplings in soup (as you can probably tell from the picture). No no – these are dumplings with soup INSIDE them! They are like delicious savory versions of Gushers Fruit Snacks. They also have a nice morsel of pork to go along with the soup in each one. I’d say these are pretty unique!    How delicious was the food? So good! That gush of soup as you pop these into your mouth is such a fun sensation. Plus the pork is delicious as well – for you vegetarians, they do have vegetable soup dumplings on the menu as well.    Did it fill me up for $5 or less? Sure did! They are definitely small, which is great because you can pop a whole one into your mouth and not worry about losing soup, but there are 8 of them, so the whole order does make for a good lunch and the final cost is $4.95!    Conclusion: Thanks so much Art for suggesting this place! I’ll definitely be back.

I mean, look, this place still looks super dated and service is still fairly curt. But at 6 to 8 dollars per order of pork or pork/crab soup dumplings, it not extraordinarily expensive, and they really are the best soup dumplings in the are IMO.

Maybe two of the waitresses here are respectful and treat you what I would consider normal.    You don't get anything unless you ask for it. Even then it might not happen. Refill tea or water? Took 45 minutes. I asked for another spoon to scoop the sauce into the soup dumpling and it took a mini argument to even get one.    We got one person to order all the dishes and the waitress said that the other guests on our table will be charged $5 if they don't order anything and gave us an attitude when we tried explaining to her that we just got one person to order everything    Bathroom is extremely disgusting. The hand dryer doesn't work and there are never any paper towels to use.    Left less than 15% tip once (8 cents less) and got stopped before leaving saying I didn't leave enough tip.,Supreme Restaurant,100 Mott St

You can see them making the buns and steaming them in open air since the steaming place is not hidden in the kitchen.    However, I had very bad stomach ache and headache the next day. My friends did not have this problem because they did not eat it. I suspect it's the soup buns but not sure if it's because I just became sick because of cold.",Supreme Restaurant,100 Mott St

They ordered a Shanghai fried rice and it came out as a white rice... They asked the waitress and she said next time you order.. Make sure to tell them to use soy sauce? No offer to make it again or anything... ""Next Time"".. We never had our water refilled.. And we only left a 10% tip... And when we were leaving the guy who took the check said ""excuse me.. You only left $2 for your server it should be 20%.. $4"" we were a little shocked that they were demanding 20% tip when a tip is courtesy anyway.. So overall food good..

The restaurant is on the small side, and smaller groups/couples are likely to be seated at large tables with other parties (only with your permission), but the staff excels at moving the service along without ever making you feel rushed. As such, do not get discouraged by long wait lines during busy hours- it is well worth the wait for the food.    The food- the soup dumplings are some of the best in NYC. I personally prefer them to rivals Joe Shanghai or New Green Bo. Also excellent are the Spicy Beef Stew, the Shanghai Rice Cakes, and the Eggplant w/ Garlic and Meat Sauce.

The tables were the same, the chairs, layouts, everything. I thought they were renovating for improvements. However, the soup dumplings weren't as great as I had expected them to be. The dough was more thick and might possibly still be raw in some area around the top. The fillings were little. The Shanghai lo mein didn't taste right. I just didn't have a good experience. My expectation of the place and the food it can produce were not met. By the way, did I mention that we were seated next to a complete stranger when there were also other seats available? Didn't really get that at all but I feel that the strangers were also feeling awkward as well. Both of us were having a party of two and we're sharing a table for 4 like we're friends or something. Like, what's up with that? We can see that were are like at least 4 other tables for 2 available. Why not seat us with one of those?

The dumplings look the same, but taste bland. Some other traditional Chinese dishes on the menu also taste similarly bland. I think soup dumplings at Joe's Shanghai are much better.  Don't expect pleasant service at all. The waiters are rude. First, they only take cash. Second, if your gratitude is less than 20%,  they will yell at you. I gave them 17% for a rushed service and got yelled at for paying too little.  I tried to reason with the guy. He only demanded more. I walked out of the restaurant fuming.

Their menu ranges from safe bets to some more unfamiliar territory that someone who isn't well-versed in Chinese food might not recognize. But it's all delicious. Service is quick but not super personably. The food is not the highest quality, but it's better than middle of the road. The prices and portions are more than generous.

My other fave dish at this restaurant is the Shanghai noodle but be warned that it is quite greasy.

We were seated, and waited approximately 10 minutes before we had to ask for a menu.    Then, when we were ready to order, we waited to see if a server would come and take our order. Again, we had to flag a staff member down.    Finally, the only time the service was fast was when it came to our food.    Don't get me wrong, this place is great food wise, but we don't know what we did to get such lousy service.    When it came to check-out we paid our bill and came to the conclusion a 10% tip was appropriate. Food was great, service was terrible.    As we were leaving, a staff member flagged us down and demanded a bigger tip. His reason was because we were a large party (6 people). If that's the reason to get crappy service, then make sure you come in as a small group.    This, is the main reason why I'm giving the place 2 stars.

My wife and kids were literally stopped and hold by the cold face 3 waitresses to give them more tips because we only left 12.5% ($82 bill and we gave $10 tip based on their average rushing services).

The soup dumplings are packed with flavor and juice. But you must eat them fast as the skin will quickly get tough as it cools down.

The Schezuan soup dumplings are a staple of every visit. Scallion pancakes also fried perfectly and not oily like I've had the misfortune of having. Good luck grabbing the steamy dumplings and dunking them in the spicy oil with chop sticks. I managed two before dropping it mid way across the table. The General Tso's was also great with crispy chicken pieces and sweet sauce.    One thing to keep in mind is that while the restaurant is a good size, it fills up quickly.

Remember that the soup inside of the steamed buns are extremely hot. I recommend letting it sit for a few minutes before approaching. As I mentioned in my check-in, the way that I love to eat it is:    1) delicately pick up steamed bun and place into soup spoon  2) take a small bite from the side of the bun  3) suck lightly to get a bit of the juicy soup out  4) pour into the hole you've bitten out some of the black vinegar  5) devour in one bite  6) enjoy the explosion in your mouth and try not to burn yourself",Supreme Restaurant,100 Mott St

28289,215,91,Chinese,5,05/25/2020,One of my favorite nyc restaurants that will forever have a special place in my heart.  I always get the pork soup dumplings-fried rice of any kind-and sesame chicken. The portions are so filling for such a great price.,Supreme Restaurant,100 Mott St
28290,216,91,Chinese,1,05/26/2018,"I was walking through Chinatown with 2 friends the other day. We were looking for a good restaurant in the middle of the week after work. We stopped at this one as there were way more people in comparison with others. The food was not outstanding but quite good for the price. I put 1 star as the staff is super rude. 20 minute before closing they were no accepting more food order that I can understand, but there is a polite way to say it and we were treated more like animals. They never told us it was cash only. Hopefully we had enough in cash. But at the end they were not happy with the tips and we asked for the closest ATM but they wouldn't help before 3 attempts to ask. At the end I went to the ATM and a guy from the restaurant followed me until it (2 blocks away) ==> Creepy situation. At the end the ATM was delivering only 20 dollar bill so I told the guy will I get change? He was not able to respond so I said: you know what? You guys didn't deserved a single tips for service in the first place so  I will not add more than we added to the check.",Supreme Restaurant,100 Mott St
28291,217,91,Chinese,3,05/26/2018,Got some dumplings here with friends and found the service quick and food served hot. It's a high turnover place so they start pressuring you to leave within an hour. Reasonable prices.,Supreme Restaurant,100 Mott St
28292,218,91,Chinese,5,05/25/2020,"Great place! Very diverse menu, large plates and very quick and welcoming staff. We found this place by chance, just wondering around Chinatown, looking for a place to have dinner, and were very pleasantly surprised by what we got. The restaurant looks just like any other, but what puts it well above the rest is the food and the service. Will definitely be happy to come back",Supreme Restaurant,100 Mott St
28293,219,91,Chinese,3,05/25/2020,"Food was great, we ordered the mixed vegetables & mushroom on rice. Unfortunately we got mushroom with ricecake, which was tasty too, but not what we ordered. And there's not much Choice for a vegetarian.  The vibe was like we were in a hurry because of the quick transactions. As soon as our plates we gone, they threw the check on the table. It was really loud inside.  I would only go there again, when I took takeout.",Supreme Restaurant,100 Mott St
28294,220,91,Chinese,5,05/26/2018,Ordered soup dumpling pork and shanghi wonton soup and chicken fried noodle.  Great food.  Each dish costs 6 bucks.    Went there during lunch.  Pack of people!   We sat on a shared table with strangers.   It was fun.    The food came out in 3 min.  Ha!    Would definitely visit again.,Supreme Restaurant,100 Mott St
28295,221,91,Chinese,4,05/27/2015,"I thank my friend Michelle for introducing me to the beautiful world of Xiao Long Bao, aka soup dumplings. We ventured into Chinatown to Shanghai Cafe since they're known for having some of the best. I've been here a few times since my initial visit and it's always packed. From casual dinner to after-work snacks, this place houses all different sorts of people. Their menu is diverse with plenty to choose from. I've had their noodles, dumplings, soup dumplings, etc... And it's all equally delicious! The portions are big enough to share with a group and the food comes out very quick. I'd skip Joe's and come straight to Shanghai. It's worth it!",Supreme Restaurant,100 Mott St
28296,222,91,Chinese,3,05/26/2017,"There is no wait system, walk in and stand by the counter and hope they notice you... Often times you'll be skipped for friends and family. Be patient and polite and you'll get a seat without too much of a wait time. Ate here twice and although both times were good, I'd say the first time was better. The Soup Dumplings were steamed well and the other dishes were great, Chili Dumplings and Rice cakes with Beef and Pickled Cabbage. The second time was for the New Year... The Crab and Pork and Pork steamed Mini Buns could have used a minute or two more of cooking time the second time I came.  Still, I'd come again as sometimes the third try is the best, and because the wait time is shorter and just as good to better than Joe's Shanghai and Joe's Ginger.    Update: 2/25/17  Came back for the third time... and was still great! Had Jelly Fish which was cool and crisp and tasted great and the well known Soup Dumplings, rice cake and boiled and fried dumplings. Third time was the best time.    One criticisms I have is that this time spent more here with 3 people and left a $6.00 and some change tip on a $58.00 bill. That's about 12%. The server complained in Chinese under her breath and than as we were leaving another server or manager said we needed to pay 15% on bills over $50. There was no notice on the door, counters, menu or receipt to inform of that... We didn't get any special treatment other than take order, drop it off... No water refills or asked if we wanted more drinks (beer and tea of which we only had one) or anything more..    The problem wasn't paying more of a tip... it was with being confronted after we paid and heading out the door... It'd be better to inform the patrons of your rule of 15% before they dine or when they pay the bill or even on the menu... I didn't want my friend arguing with the server any longer so I gave in and gave them more 18%. So even though the food was great and had some nice talks with some stranger at a communal table, I still hold onto my 3 stars for now...",Supreme Restaurant,100 Mott St
28297,223,91,Chinese,1,05/26/2018,"Food doesn’t taste as good as it used to, service is horrible. We ordered two servings of soup dumplings and later ordered more food.. we ordered two more dishes but the waitress said you need to spend a minimum of $5 a person...  nowhere does it say that on the menu.. and we told her we already ordered soup dumplings.. such a nasty attitude!    I used to come here for just the food but now the food isn’t as good and you get treated horribly, I advise you to go elsewhere if you want better food and service",Supreme Restaurant,100 Mott St
28298,224,91,Chinese,1,05/26/2018,"I have never left a bad review for a restaurant because I hate to ever tarnish the image of a business if it happened to be a one time thing. But, after reading the other reviews I felt it was necessary. We definitely were treated differently because we were American tourists going to this restaurant in China Town. They were rude from the beginning. Our food was mediocre and we were never asked how our dinner was nor offered any refills of our water. After paying our bill (which had to be cash) the waitress had the nerve to say that she wanted more of a tip than the 15% that was left for her and wanted to argue with us as we tried to leave. When we walked out the chefs were waving at us sarcastically. It was very uncomfortable.",Supreme Restaurant,100 Mott St
28299,225,91,Chinese,4,05/27/2015,"Soup dumplings are a mainstay here, but the skins were thicker and soup not as hot as it could be, so they were all right but not amazingly good. Luckily, the rest of the menu is solid Chinese comfort food, so you can't go wrong with the meatball casserole or the chili fish. Also, if you're concerned about the rudeness of the servers, I basically assume that service in Chinatown will be brusque, so if you're Chinese speaking, just be a little more assertive with what you want and you'll get it, no big deal.",Supreme Restaurant,100 Mott St
28300,226,91,Chinese,2,05/25/2020,"The food service wass fast but the flavor of the food was questionable, even their hot oil was disappointing. The waiters weren't attentive and leave you feeling ignored; I needed to flag them down twice for service. Of course, they sure are fast to collect your check. The restroom was disgusting. They provided watered down soap, their hand dryer was broken and the 2 paper dispensers were not stocked. I would avoid this place.",Supreme Restaurant,100 Mott St
28301,227,91,Chinese,4,05/27/2012,Soup dumplings! steamed or fried they are delicious. Everything here is fresh and cheap. Ice cold beer to go along with the dumplings and all the other choices are perfect for sharing. even if there is a wait to be seated thins move fast and I've never waited a few minutes to get a table. make sure your entire party is there to get a table as soon as possible. Be prepared to be seated with another group if you have an odd number of people in your group/turn up during high volume times....,Supreme Restaurant,100 Mott St

28304,0,92,Chinese,4,05/25/2022,"Dumplings (steamed) are my go to choice as it is made in the style I am accustomed.  Traditional Chinese style of thin wrappers filled with ground pork, to dip in a spicy vinegar soy sauce mixture to dip in. Cannot tell if it’s handmade. Irregardless, it doesn’t matter as it pleases my palate.    Other items on the menu are fine, and quite acceptable for a quick meal. Ingredients are fresh and cooked with care. The sauces are light enough to enjoy natural flavors, though it feels like they use a diluted version of usual hood Chinese sauces that have a sweet and tangy flavor and a generous amount of cornstarch in thickened sauces.    Besides dumplings, I would likely order chicken and cashew next as it reminds me of kung pao chicken the way I am accustomed to. I hope they include more traditional Chinese food items over time to stand out even more from nearby Chinese takeout spots.    Delivery service is more than satisfactory, as it arrives quickly. I have not yet ordered at a peak time, however, whenever I have made an order they are efficient and food is spanking hot, so that’s how you know it’s coming from right off the stove. It’s nice that they include fortune cookies.",Dynasty Chinese Restaurant - Brooklyn,1669 Flatbush Ave

28308,4,92,Chinese,2,01/25/2023,"Ordered food delivery yesterday. The beef soup with rice noodles is fine, even though it became more ""watery"" since the last time I've tried it. It reminded me water mixed with red pepper to provide at least some flavor. Vegetables that were on a side with pork were not fresh. So I put aside most of them just to be safe. Chicken wings were small and I would call it ""super crispy"". Or overfried, if you prefer. But the most unpleasant thing is that as soon as I bite a piece of that I felt the strong smell of ammonia. So I threw all of them away. So not fresh,  strange taste, and dangerous because of the risk of poisoning. Even though that place was great about 3 years ago.",Dynasty Chinese Restaurant - Brooklyn,1669 Flatbush Ave

33280,3,113,Chinese,3,09/27/2022,"I must say, this place has really gone down hill. They used to make the best pork egg foo young but over the last 3 years it has taken a turn for the worst the flavor is off the onions are way too big nothing tastes the same over there I pray that they get better but if they got rid of the original cook that was there about 4 years ago they have done a wrong thing they need to get that cook back  I have not had pork egg foo young from them since I've tried it three times after thinking maybe it was just a bad night it has gone downhill they need to check the cook and cut them onions much smaller",Great Wall Restaurant,370 W Market St
33835,0,119,Chinese,4,10/27/2022,"I used to go to the location in Chinatown, which I think is closed now, so I was delighted to see that they have this location on the upper West side. Very friendly team of servers. Everything we had was tasty and similar to what I remember of the downtown location. The only thing I would say is that the prices are a little crazy for dim sum. If you were there for good whether they have a large space outdoors, that is very pleasant.",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33836,1,119,Chinese,5,11/26/2022,Very good dim sum!! Thin skin and tasty fillings for shrimp dumplings and duck taro mesh dumplings.  Stir fried beef and vegetables are very good too! Would go again next time in NYC.,Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33837,2,119,Chinese,5,05/18/2023,This place is a great dumplings spot!  Jing Fong on the UWS offers an wide variety of delicious  dumplings and classic Asian dishes  - definitely get the Chicken  Siu Mai and the BBQ Roast Pork  Buns! Prices  are fair. I wish their service was faster and that their AC  worked better!,Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33838,3,119,Chinese,3,12/26/2022,"Went around 11:30AM, and they didn't have the dim sum carts, just a menu-based system. Food itself was just okay. Some things, although they looked nice, felt like the quality I could've made at home... (why does the duck filling have the consistency of refried beans?)",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33839,5,119,Chinese,5,10/27/2022,"As always. We usually go to one that it’s in China Town neighborhood, and it was our first visit in UWS location.    Compared to China Town Jin Fong, most of the dimsums are made when kitchen has the order. We experienced, what they called, Dim Sum Carts in China Town, and the Dim Sums were sometimes dried so that it was a bit tricky to get it off from the paper that came underneath for plating.    However, UWS location had amazing service and fresh cooked Dim Sums. We ordered Shu Mai,Har Gow, Crab Spinach Dim Sum, Pork Bun, Sweet&Sour Soup, Beef fried rice, Prawn Lobster Sauce.    We ordered enough to eat for three people and still got the bill under $100    Fast service, great food, fresh and good atmosphere with open kitchen!    Highly recommend",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33840,6,119,Chinese,5,05/25/2022,The food was as good as I remember!  It’s definitely not like the all place.  This place is tiny and you don’t have the carts being pushed around.  I’m Just glad the food is just as delicious.  The staff is friendly and helpful!  Make sure you make reservations by call not email though and make reservations it gets busy!  Highly recommend for the food!,Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33841,7,119,Chinese,4,05/25/2022,"How does a place like this not have wontons? The shrimp chow fun was great. Pork buns, har gow and pan fried shrimp and chive also very good. Pan fried pork were very heavy. I hope to have the wonton noodle soup next time.",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33842,8,119,Chinese,5,02/24/2023,"Excellent soup dumplings and shrimp rice rolls. But oddly the standouts were not dim sum but the vegetable dishes we ordered, especially the Chinese cauliflower which was like nothing we’d tasted and really delicious",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33843,9,119,Chinese,2,02/24/2023,"We didn't feel welcomed during the whole dining experience. When we finished eating, the impatient waiter rushed taking away plates and spilled sauce on the table and almost on my friend. He just left and didn't even apologize. This person also never checked up on us. As unpleasant as it was, I didn't know if our waiter had a bad day, so we still tipped okay. But probably won't risk coming here again.    Dim sum was okay. Soup was over-seasoned. don't recommend it if you have a big day the next day. At this price, you can get way better dim sum with better service and atmosphere in Midtown or Chinatown.",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33844,10,119,Chinese,5,11/26/2022,"Jing Fong Upper West Side has a variety of dumplings!! One for everyone: steamed, fried, soup, and much more!! Very friendly vibes and service!!",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33845,11,119,Chinese,1,05/25/2022,Not recommended restaurant. The food is too way expensive especially the Dimsum. We waited 20mins for the siumai and it taste terrible. The sticky rice is too small for the price of $8/2,Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33846,12,119,Chinese,5,04/25/2023,1st time going was yesterday and I plan on coming back with friends and family. Dim sum is pretty pricey as you van get the same stuff down town for half the price but it was still amazing. I had the general Sao as well for my main dish and it was amazing spicy as I love it and the chicken was huge. Would definitely recommend.,Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33847,13,119,Chinese,1,12/26/2022,"Very bad food and service. I went to this restaurant with a friend. Ever since we got there, the server did not treat us nicely. When we kindly asked for suggestions about the menu, the staff got annoyed.  We were very hungry so in spite of the bad service, we decided to stay. When we received our meal, we were quite disgusted. The veggies were clearly not fresh and defrosted. The meat was uncooked and looked like dog food and the taste was absolutely bad. We just couldn’t eat it. After waiting another long time to get the attention of the staff we complained about the food. They got offended about us complaining. It was overall a bad experience that ruined our evening. I do not recommend this place - save your money, a headache, and a belly ache.",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33848,14,119,Chinese,1,05/25/2021,"I wouldn't come to this place if I knew they serve everything in plastic dishes. Each table makes so much waste, it is incredible. This business has no care for environment. They have a mountain of dumpster nearby that they build throughout the day.    Food is so bad too. We ordered 8 different dishes, including 2 deserts. All of them were just blant and tasteless.    Nobody should dine here and produce this much waste.",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33849,15,119,Chinese,5,01/25/2023,"I recommend the chicken and salt fish fried rice here. They really nail it; not too fishy but not bland. I also really like the Lo mein and the BBQ roast pork is sensational, just get a plate of it and chow down.    Unfortunately i found the fried shrimp wontons bland which is unusual. The shrimp wonton soup is perfect for a cold day. Honestly i don’t like everything here, but what they do well you really should not miss.",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33850,16,119,Chinese,3,05/25/2020,It was decent. I've never had mind blowing dim sum. I thought the food was alright but nothing stood out to me. I don't think I'll be back again. The selection of foods was limited and I didn't see many noodle or rice dishes. The dessert cart was disappointing. I was looking forward to some really good dim sum but it was just the ordinary. I also thought it was pricey or what it waa. Each dish was $4. The peking duck and chicken feet were my favorite. Everything else was meh.  I was here on a holiday for lunch but I didn't have to wait to be seated. The place is huge and lots of seating. The tea is great and they charge $1 a person so don't be too surprised when you get the bill.,Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33851,17,119,Chinese,5,05/25/2021,"The essential dim sum/Cantonese-style spot in Manhattan! Definitely come here for the classic experience of ordering off of food carts being pushed around the restaurant. (I haven’t gone back since pre-Covid, so not sure how it’s functioning now) The food is delicious, authentic, and comprehensive in its selections. You can find your typical dim sums like shrimp dumplings and the more obscure items that won’t be offered everywhere. It’s great to be able to see the different food out in the open and try them out. Besides its dim sums, there are also entrees you can order from its menu.",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33852,18,119,Chinese,5,02/24/2023,Food was outstanding. Loved the soup dumplings and the scallion pancakes. Entrees we’re great as well. Overall this place was amazing and I’m already thinking about coming back,Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33853,19,119,Chinese,4,02/24/2023,"As authentic as it gets Chinese style, not just the food but the entire production. You are seated with strangers on large round tables and wait for servers to come by offering you food. It is a La cart and an experience for anyone who is a fan of Eastern culinary delights.",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33854,20,119,Chinese,3,05/25/2020,"No doubt that the quality of the dim sum is of the best in the area. A large dining room also ensures little wait in regard to seating. However the service itself is subpar at best. Despite plenty of staff roaming the floor, not all are responsive or communicable, with no distinct waiting staff in sight. The Dim Sum carts themselves don’t follow a specific pattern either, you’ll ultimately have to stand up and chase a cart yourself in order to get what you’re looking for. Hit or miss depending on when you go, but the quality of the food makes up for mediocre service any day.",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33855,21,119,Chinese,5,05/25/2021,"I ordered food for pick up. It only took 15 mins. We had steamers shrimp noodles, mapo tofu and jumbo shrimp with sauce. Shrimp noodles were excellent, jumbo shrimp delicious and mapo tofu nice and spicy. Mapo tofu was definitely my favorite.",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33856,22,119,Chinese,4,04/25/2023,"The food at Jin Fong is really good and the service is fast. Favorites are the shrimp and chive dumplings, lo mein, general Tao chicken, and the wonton soup is delicious. If it’s crowded, I can get a little bit loud… But other than that, it’s a really good go to Chinese restaurant on the upper West side. Also great for takeout.",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33857,23,119,Chinese,5,03/26/2023,"Recommend getting there when they open, it fills up pretty quickly. Amazing dim sum! Best I've had outside of San Francisco. Speedy service and in an interesting area to walk around Chinatown and Little Italy. Cha Shiu Bao were so good! We also had some very tasty taro cakes as well as some sesame balls.",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33858,24,119,Chinese,5,05/25/2021,Great dim sum place in Chinatown! We came for  Saturday lunch because there was a long line at Nam Wah. This place's indoor dining is permanently closed but they still have outdoor dining for few more months before they close this location down. Their food was delicious and service was fast. I would definitely recommend this more than Nam Wah if u want real authentic dim sum. Hopefully we'll get to come again before they close.,Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33859,25,119,Chinese,3,05/25/2021,"I miss eating here in person, they do have about 35% in person now and the line was an hour, cash only inside. They're scheduled to close the inside dining around March 7th. The to-go section is a screened window where you can order most items. Inefficient at calling people (masks mute the sound of them calling out) so check in and stay close if others don't show or aren't there. You may get in faster.  Outside the store has four seating tables, too.",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33860,26,119,Chinese,3,05/26/2018,"This place is probably the largest dim sum place in Manhattan. And even though there is a bit of a line, it moves fairly quickly. It’s a great place to go with a group since most tables can seat up to 8 people. If you want the nostalgia of the dim sum cart system, this one is for you. While I personally prefer made-to-order dim sum, the carts are an experience and there is a good variety of dishes. The quality of food is varied and anything fried is a gamble - it could be cold and dried out as was the case of my bacon wrapped shrimp.",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33861,27,119,Chinese,3,05/26/2019,"Food pricing in this restaurant has continued to go up in recent years with the quality going down and items shrinking! Dim sum pricing on weekdays is higher, but having not been here for a couple of years, returning to experience the food was worth a shot on a Monday. We went today and the place was packed because of the holiday. Wish we had our own table, but we had to share a table. The pricing on the special dim sum items was ridiculously high to say the least.",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33862,28,119,Chinese,5,05/25/2020,"First time to this place. Let me tell you, the food is good and the service is great. Planning to come back next time my family and I are in town. The beef and broccoli is good and the sesame chicken is to die for. Great flavors.",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33863,29,119,Chinese,2,05/26/2019,"The place is big and staffs very friendly but is not so clean with the carpet. Waiters clothes need change more frequently, look dirty. The dim sum are so so... not very tastes. We give 2 stars because the dishes are not tastes good.",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33864,30,119,Chinese,4,03/26/2023,It doesn’t have the Chinatown size or vibe but definitely a great value for the neighborhood and authentic Chinese cuisine. The staff is friendly and prompt but ready to speak up since it can get loud inside. 1 star deducted because there was a sign posted on the bathroom saying it wasn’t working but it actually was.,Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33865,31,119,Chinese,4,05/26/2018,"Weekends can get packed (see pics), so show up around 10 AM earliest to get a table immediately while not getting Dim Sum too early. Wait times can be 30 minutes or longer if you show up after 11-11:30 AM.    It has been been years since I ate at Jing Fong and it's improved a lot. The quality of the food is better and the service seems to have improved too. Because it's a large venue the wait time is generally not that bad. Definitely a repeat  dim sum spot, but there are a few other good locations a few steps away if you're looking for a quick bite.",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33866,32,119,Chinese,4,05/26/2019,"Huge space! Lots of choices and tasty food. Prices are adorable for new York, but not super cheap! The soup dumplings have thicker skin than I prefer, but they are still very good!",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33867,33,119,Chinese,4,05/26/2018,"Delightful dim sum place. We found almost all sorts items we were looking for. The food was fresh and tasty. We were sitting at the very end of the hall, so the carts didn't come by as often. Also, some items are served in a common area, which we had to get by ourselves. Didn't know that for a while until finally the server clearly told us so. The servers were also not consistent with service, taking a while to check our table and getting us our order. Would love to see them improve their service. But the food was up to the mark.",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33868,34,119,Chinese,5,05/26/2017,Huge and overwhelming place. A minute after being seated we already had some dim sum on our table since the waiters carry them around in big carts. Everything was really tasty and fresh (might pass on the steamed buns though). We came during business lunch (which I think is until 1.30pm) so most dishes of dim sum cost 2.95$. great price for a great meal.,Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33869,35,119,Chinese,5,05/25/2020,"This is my go to dim sum spot in the heart of Chinatown. Love the multiple levels and large dining space. Came here around 11 Am on a busy Friday. My friends and I ordered the rice creep, har gow, shumai, egg tarts, taro balls, fried pork balls, spare ribs, fried rice and a bunch of other dishes. Food quality here is common like other dim sum establishments. I just frequent this location because the staff is always attentive and friendly. You can also request items as well so they come out fresh from the kitchen. Chill spot for dim sum especially for large parties as well",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33870,36,119,Chinese,4,05/25/2020,Had dim sum and banquet at this restaurant.  This is one of the Chinese restaurants that has a big Hall to hold 80 tables.  It is not on the ground floor.  You have to take the long escalator or elevator there.  The food was okay there for both dim sum and dinner.,Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33871,37,119,Chinese,4,05/25/2020,"Came here on Sunday 1.30 PM it was crowned only have to wait for the table about 10-15 minutes, there are many dim sum dishes you may need to try what you like. I really recommended Lava Bun with slated egg york, i ate more than 3 buns (not sure how many I ate haha). One tip is sometimes you need to walk to get the dim sum it is better and faster than sitting at your table and wait for them to come close to your table",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33872,38,119,Chinese,5,05/25/2021,A little pricey but the food is very good and the restaurant is nice which would be a good date night location or nice launch . The dumplings here are awesome and I love dumplings,Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33873,39,119,Chinese,4,05/25/2020,"The atmosphere is perfect for parties, but the food is disappointing. The meat is either too salty or the taste is very dry, the fried noodles are soft and not chewy, the fruit is also dry and sour.",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33874,40,119,Chinese,3,05/25/2020,"The food was good but overpriced. The service was also poor. When we said we wanted our own table instead of sharing, the host got angry and impatient and told us she didn't know how long that would take...A table cleared up within 5 minutes and we got our own table.    After we finished eating and needed the bill calculated, the staff dismissed us for over 15 minutes. I had to walk up to the front desk where a staff member asked a host to get our bill calculated.    This is a good spot for big groups if you don't mind waiting a while for service.",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33875,41,119,Chinese,4,05/26/2019,"One of the best dim sum in NYC. Price is decent and atmosphere is just like you are in Hong Kong. Yes, waiters do not understand English but some of them are friendly and nice.    I always get Chinese chives and shrimp dumplings on the counter. And sticky rice covered by banana leaf is the must.",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33876,42,119,Chinese,3,05/26/2017,"Dim sum is a really nice way to try all sorts of dishes, finding out what you like and what you don’t like, at affordable price.    The inside had a small lobby with hostess table. When it gets packed (which I heard this place gets completely packed all the time), I assume you give your name to a staff here. On the day we went, there was no wait, so we went right up the looooong escalator. About half way up, the mood of the restaurant starts to change, with huge, beautiful chandelier.    Then there is this huge, enormous dining room, tables after tables. They have all sorts of tables, both in shape and size. Most of them are round table, small and large.    We were quickly spotted by staff (there were few staffs on stand-by right at the top of escalator). They have walkie talkie to communicate in this large space, and the staff got on the walkie talkie to tell another staff who is in charge of seating people. She called us over and we hurried over to a large round table. It is all shared table, unless you are coming with large group of people.    We were given a dim sum card as soon as we sat down, which is how they keep track of what you order. Don’t lose this one! What I really liked about this place is that they have these old-fashioned dim sum carts, pushed by female staff everywhere. Each one will be carrying something different, from dumpling, meat, tofu, baked goods, desserts… Just stop them and ask what they have, point to what you want, and they will put it on your table.    Overall, we had a great dim sum experience here. We learned what we liked and what we didn’t like, in which I can say we liked most of what we tried. I would recommend to focus on the savory dim sum here, and not their dessert. Dim sum is a fun way to eat, and great way to share with family and friends.

33878,45,119,Chinese,4,05/26/2018,"The dim sum is delicious but be prepared to wait upwards of 45 minutes on the weekends. It's the typical hectic and harried dim sum experience - and because the place is so big it can feel overwhelming. Be on the lookout for your favorite dishes and don't be shy. If you see something you want, walk up and ask for it. Don't miss the buffet setup toward the middle of the room too. They do the classics like har gau and pork bao (really fresh) but also have a few harder to find.",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33879,46,119,Chinese,3,05/26/2019,"Service was TERRIBLE!!! We had trouble ordering and the staff was very rude. After the hour it took to finally have our order taken, it took another hour to get the food. Honestly, we should’ve just left at that point. There were people going around with carts of food and it made it even more confusing because one; we didn’t know how much the food would cost and  two; we didn’t know what it was (they spoke little to no English) and I have very bad food allergies to shellfish and certain other fish so I didn’t want to risk it. The only reason I’m not giving this place a 1 or 2 star is because the food was awesome. It was the only good thing about the restaurant. Next time, we’ll just have grubhub deliver it or place an order because even though the food was that good I would not go through it again just for a bowl of ramen.",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33880,47,119,Chinese,3,05/26/2019,"Ok food. Upside is restaurant is huge so you don’t wait for that long even on weekends when they’re super busy. They’re out of lots of things though. This Saturday we went at 1pm, there was no siu Mai, no sesame balls, and no mango pudding  …",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33881,48,119,Chinese,1,05/25/2020,"This is a place that seems to have a great reputation. It’s quite grand with an escalator leading up to the dining area and beautiful chandeliers all around. The food is decent. We ordered some chow fun and mai fun but they really didn’t have much flavor. The dim sum tasted good though! Honestly, the reason why I’m giving Jing Fong a one star rating is solely due to the poor service. The staff walked along with their dim sum carts but they really only stayed in certain parts of the room. Majority of the time we sat there waiting for the carts to come to our table but they never ventured our way. To get any sort of service or food, we had to go out of our way to grab someone’s attention. Not a big fan but I will say it’s kind of cool to experience the grandness of it all, at least once. Very likely will not be going back though.",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33882,49,119,Chinese,5,05/26/2019,"First time there And I like the place a lot. The food is good, the place is great plus and something important for me, the bathrooms are clean.  First you have to understand how the place works, if you are like me and don’t know about Dim Sum here is what Wikipedia says Dim sum is a style of Chinese cuisine prepared as small bite-sized portions of food served in small steamer baskets or on a small plate. Dim sum dishes are usually served with tea and together form a full tea brunch  Then,  in the restaurant you will see women around pushing tray carts with Dim Sum, or soup or desserts. You pick what you want to eat and they’ll put a mark in a piece of paper that the waitress is going to give it to you at the begging with your tea and chopsticks. Or you can pick something form the menu (by the way shrimp fried rice is delicious ).  At the end of your meal you take the card to the cashier and pay for what you eat. Each mark on the paper has a value depending where is placed. Small, medium or large, or if you got something form  the menu or a drink that’s written on the back.  The experience is awesome plus the food is great and the prices are reasonable.  I loved the tea and the service.",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave

The dim sum is not great but the service is not only non existent, but rude. They pretend not to hear or see you when you flag them. I had to get my own water and hot sauce serving myself.  I will never go back never.",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33886,53,119,Chinese,5,05/26/2018,Controlled chaos is a good way of describing Jing Fong. We've been coming here for a few years and though the wait can be long the food is always on point. Unless you want to wait longer for an individual table be prepared to share a circular one with many others. A fun experience and definitely yummy.,Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33887,54,119,Chinese,5,05/26/2019,"Great dimsum, there’s usually a wait to be seated but it moves quickly. Easy to grab carts or flag down a waiter. Shumai is the best here",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33888,55,119,Chinese,5,05/25/2020,Staff is great and the food was perfect . Same quality as their Chinatown location but in a smaller setting. We really liked the rice noodle shrimp wrap item. Seating can be limited but otherwise great place …,Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave

33890,57,119,Chinese,1,03/26/2023,Really disappointing. I don’t normally leave reviews but the service was actually the worst I have received in years. I went twice with my partner. We hoped it was a fluke or off day but it wasn’t and def ruined the moment for us.,Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave

My main favorite dish is not in the picture but is called Shrimp in mayonnaise sauce with walnut & broccoli. (#1 pick!) & E-fu noodle with mushrooms. Soooo... good.

33894,61,119,Chinese,5,05/26/2018,"Located across from the Fifth Precinct Police Station, this restaurant is a must-do place for Chinese food. The restaurant is HUGE and easily seats large parties together. Service is unique in that the employees wear badges but, instead of names, carry numbers. For example, server 030 took my order, 026 refilled my water, 008 took my check, and 108 brought it back.    That said, the food is served piping hot and very well flavored and spiced. I had the hot and sour soup and it was quite good. The soup did have chopped peppers which added some heat. For my entree, I ordered the orange beef which was served with steamed broccoli. The beef was crispy and not mushy. The veggies were well steamed and still crunchy.  A side of rice was by request and charged ala carte.    Quick tip: signing up with Yelp Cash Back yields rewards from this restaurant!!",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave

33897,64,119,Chinese,2,05/26/2018,This place is less than mediocre. It's definitely not worth the wait. We grabbed a number and waited for over an hour. By the time we were seated it was already mid-afternoon. The carts that rolled by were half empty. The dishes we were looking out for did not come by. There was a cart that kept circling with the same soup that no one wanted. We then noticed that there was an area where they were started to release new dishes. There were people rushing over there to grab up dishes. So we joined in and got a few dishes that we wanted. They didn't have a lot of the dishes I normally expect from dim sum. The system is broken. I have never had to rush over to grab dishes that I want to eat for dim sum from all the times I've eaten it in the course of my entire life. What a terrible way to eat dim sum. We finally had to order food in order to get enough food. What a terrible experience.,Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33898,65,119,Chinese,3,02/24/2023,"Went for dim sum. Food average. Choices limited. No cart service. Go to Chinatown, Brooklyn or Ft. Lee for more authentic fare.",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33899,66,119,Chinese,2,05/25/2022,"The seafood combination only had shrimp  that was seafood which tasted microwaved. The noodles which where at the bottom of the plate where extremely skinny. The noodles looked like they opened a pack of Ramon  noodles and put it in our plate. The crab,shrimp and spinach was really good and tasteful . The soda was water downed and tasted terrible as if it came from a dirty pipe. They didn’t even had a menu for any type of drinks. also the crab pop was terrible because it’s so small.",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33900,67,119,Chinese,5,05/26/2019,"At the heart of Chinatown in Manhattan you can eat good for a good price if you agree with the fact, sometimes you need to share your table with unknown persons due to the crowd who wanna eat between 12am and 3pm.

33901,68,119,Chinese,5,05/25/2020,"The dim sum is hot, fresh, authentic, and delicious. The servers are helpful and the prices are VERY reasonable! Definitely worth a visit if in the area.

33904,71,119,Chinese,4,05/26/2019,Giant big banquet hall bustling with trays and trays of dim sum. Gets packed quick any days of the week and there's usually a long queue during the weekends. Dim sums are as authentic as it gets but can be unrealistically frugal with giving out there chilli sauce. But definitely an experience worth trying out when visiting Chinatown in New York City.,Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave

33908,75,119,Chinese,2,05/26/2018,"Compared to the one in Chinatown, this place was very pricy and only had limited selection. It was around 7 to 8 dollars for one order of dimsum. We visited on Sunday afternoon. It seemed a bit busy and took a while to take our orders. The quality of food was fine but in my opinion, it doesn't justify the price. I would much prefer the one in Chinatown even with the wait.",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave

33910,77,119,Chinese,4,05/26/2019,Good place to go for weekend dim sum brunch. There is some downtime while they set up for dinner at 6 pm. Dim sum dishes are typically $6 or 7 each but there are some higher ones so ask for a dim sum menu if you want to know. Cocktails are available but disappointing - $13 for a very weak Mai Tai is poor value. The ribs are good but the chow fun was disappointing. Brunch dim sum is better than dinner and less likely to have half the room taken by a wedding it other celebration.,Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33911,78,119,Chinese,5,05/26/2019,"This place is huge. There were probably 20 groups, but it still felt empty in the vast space. Either the fans of the air conditioning or rather the sound boxes gave a disturbing rattling sound. After a ciuple of minutes the music started. You instantly feel like being in Beijing when you enter this place. It starts with the long escalators. The elevator was out of order. This place really does not feel like NYC.  The air conditioning works. It’s been freezing cold.  The selection of dim sum is great.    Although some of this is really not five stars the food made up for all of this. And after all this was the reason we came. Rock on!",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave

You can pay half the price at neighboring restaurants for the same or a better product. However, as a first time it—is a nice experience. Go in here prepared. Expect carelessness, and forget your food! Don’t wait around for others to come serve you. Cart operators will be roaming around with food, bring your service card (which doubles as a receipt) and fight for your meal!",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33919,87,119,Chinese,5,05/26/2019,Love this place! Has been my go-to dim-sum in NYC for years.  The elaborate banquet style setting has its charm and the food is delicious.

33920,88,119,Chinese,5,12/26/2022,Best dim sum of my life. Best dim sum on the upper west side and arguably the best in NYC. I’ve been to dim sum often in Chinatown and Queens but this is the best.,Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33921,89,119,Chinese,5,05/26/2019,"Delicious! My favorite place in NY. You take these escalators up stairs to this gigantic ballroom of tables, and you are promptly seated.

Check it out",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave

33923,91,119,Chinese,5,05/26/2018,Special food. Couldn't understand a word but the dumplings were delicious. The plates are huge. Don't go by yourself cause its a lot of food. The price is good. You can take home the leftovers.,Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33924,92,119,Chinese,5,05/25/2021,"I'll remember the escalator the most. It was my first memory of one. The longest one I've ever seen. Once you arrive at the landing, you'd see a ballroom full of families and conversations. At night. Itll turn into a 3 party floor with divisions separating a wedding, a 80th birthday party, and just regular banquet dinners for smaller parties. Now it's a remnant of the past. A covid welcoming party to check you in. Tea bags in plastic containers if you dine outside. Take out containers for your dimsum. None of the dimsum ladies who called you Lang jai and asked you what village you came from. But the wholesomeness of dimsum remains the same. The bright eyes as your food arrives, and the first bite of the food. It really does touch your heart. Thanks for all the memories Jing Fong.",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33925,93,119,Chinese,3,05/26/2019,Decent dim sum but nothing to brag about. Definitely not the best in Manhattan. Attract crowds due to the newly renovated interior and the size of the establishment.

33935,103,119,Chinese,5,05/26/2018,"Extremely popular and classic dim sum place in New York's Chinatown. The crowd at the bottom of the escalator isn't waiting to talk to the hostess. Everyone is waiting for their number to be called, so be sure to walk confidently to the front of the crowd to the hostess at the bottom of the escalators to request your number.    From the minute you get to the top of the escalator you know you're in for an authentic experience. The huge dining room is  buzzing with conversation and energy - locals, families, tourists and the occasional celebrity going incognito. The carts filled to the brim with dumplings,  steamed vegetables and noodles. They serve congee, but unfortunately do not have youtiao (delicious chinese fried dough that looks like churros) that usually gets served with it. (Full disclosure, we sneaked our own youtiao and people at other tables kept asking the poor wait staff to bring them some...)    Oh, and they are now serving alcohol with dim sum! So feel free to flag down one of the staff to ask for a mimosa or one of their fun drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) as an additional treat!",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33936,104,119,Chinese,4,05/25/2020,"Authentic dimsum, really not bad at all. Lighter than usual, hence the 4 stars but this is largely down to personal taste. There's a nice bank of Citi bikes right outside too, so easy to get to and convenient if you want to work it off after. Really great Shanghai style dumplings. Really meaty har gaw, sui mai",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave

I will be back!",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33938,106,119,Chinese,2,05/26/2019,"Surprised at the 4 star rating. Food not that great, at least at 3pm when we were there. Dim sum dry (siu mai) and overcooked (choi sum). And veg and rice rolls were needlessly drowning in sauce. Disappointing.",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave

33962,131,119,Chinese,1,05/25/2022,"Food: Okay. I’ve had better, but it did what it needed to do.    Customer Service: NEVER IN MY LIFE have I had an experience like this. At the beginning everything was fine. We ordered and they dropped off the food. There was nothing spectacular about it. My friend spoke mandarin so that help with the language barrier.    The check comes; I put a 10% tip and paid for it. I usually tip 20% but it slipped my mind and put 10. The waiter comes back, points at the check, says something in an annoyed manner. I could not hear because he was wearing a mask. I asked him to repeat what he said, he rudely flashed me off and leaves. I was so confused,  then my friend told me he said you’re only going to pay 10%.    Now I had no problem updating the tip, because again, I did not realize I put 10% and the service was okay. So for him to rudely brush me off like that was crazy. I have never had anyone bring back my check AND try to shame me/get mad at me for my tip nor have I seen it happen to anyone else.    I won’t return, but maybe you’ll have a better experience.    Price: The dimsum ranges from $7-8 and you only get two or three depending on the item. I shared the food with my friend and paid $20 each for 5 small plates.",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave

The noodles were also great, maybe even better than some dumplings.  A way for this place to be even better: invest in a turning table typical of Chinese restaurants so that the large round table would more easily share food and drinks.  Overal, a nice place that I'll visit many more times.",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave

He didn’t come to help at first, and when he finally came, he brought some water in a bad attitude without any respect or patience.

33979,148,119,Chinese,2,05/25/2022,"I went to Jing Fong recently after they renovated. It’s a much much smaller place now and food selection is so limited, only the basic dim sums. I went with a bigger group the first time and waited for more than an hour. So the second time, we were only 4 people. I thought waiting would be shorter because they have more smaller tables than bigger tables. We waited for one hour again! Even worse, since we were only 4 people, 2 carts arrived at the moment we just sat down passing as many dishes as possible into our table. We need to shout  we don’t want this and that. We finished dim sum pretty fast since our table was crammed with all dishes in the first 2 mins. We wanted to relax sipping the tea ( especially after they bombardjng all dishes the moment we sat down). The manager came over asking us to leave because there is a line outside. Of course, we give away the table right away to the people who were waiting. My experience was 1) waiting is too long, more than an hour no matter small group or big group. 2) they tried to rush you out at the moment you sit down. Traditionally, weekend sim dum is where you chat, sip tea, and have dim sum - you can’t do this in this new Jing Fong. But if you are only looking for eating dim sums and leave and don’t mind one hour’s wait, then you are fine. 3) dim sum selection is limited    Overall, I won’t go back. Two experiences are enough to come to this conclusion.",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave

33981,150,119,Chinese,5,05/26/2019,"Brooklyn is better than manhattan but Jing Fong makes me rethink my opinion of this. This dim sum is bomb. It’s UWS prices (barely) but you pay for what you get. The food is bomb. The service is impeccable and the decor amazing. If you’re looking for a bomb place with good eats - it’s Jing Fong. Highly recommend, and get the Japanese whiskey",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave

I tried a variety of the dim sum menu - the pork buns had a great BBQ flavor, the rice noodles had the tight texture, and the flavors and fillings for all the dumplings were spot on. Also, I appreciated the large amount of chili garlic and Jasmine tea that came with the meal. Very anti-covid friendly outdoor seating and worth sitting in the cold (warm up with the tea or the hot and sour soup, which was also a great addition to the meal!)",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave

You need to be authoritative in waving down servers, but within ten minutes of sitting down, we had a whole feast for our table.

Expect a wait to get in - the large crowd in the lobby and outside on the sidewalk is all for this place! Worth it. If you come with just a few people, expect to share the table with another party or two. A larger group gets their own table, of course. Also, dim sum here is something of an event - be prepared to chase down a cart or two if they pass by your table without stopping. You'll need to flag a waiter for drinks, too. It's so busy in here that they don't check in unless you flag them down. It sounds crazy, I know, but it's all part if the experience and it's great!",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33993,164,119,Chinese,4,05/25/2022,"Great food, except I think this place doesnt match up to the original Jing Fong in chinatown.

Their seafood was better than meat.",Jing Fong - UWS,380 Amsterdam Ave
33994,165,119,Chinese,5,05/25/2020,"Best dim sum in town. We have tried many different places, and this one always wins for us. They offer a terrific variety of traditional and inventive small dishes, with everything from shrimp to pork to veggies and every possible combination.    Aside from the food, the atmosphere is fun for locals as well as tourists. You sit in a HUGE open dining room with a flood of busy carts racing by. the noise and the hustle-bustle are part of the charm.    The only drawback is that you have to get there early on weekends. If you arrive past 11:00 AM, you are likely to have a one-hour wait or longer. Better, try it during the week. You can usually go there around 12 noon, and get in without any difficulty. The variety is a bit smaller during the week, but the quality is just a good.    Great NYC institution.

The food was decent, the staff was rude and absent most of the time. They did push CD's and said that all would be signed by Kenny after the show. We were near the end of the line and as we got closer to Kenny, the club manager barked at his paying customers that we would have to hurry (we stood patiently in line for 15 minutes) because he had people waiting outside in the rain for one and a half hours and needed to get them inside.

44382,0,174,Chinese,4,05/26/2022,"I ordered the pork chop bento and Taiwanese style rice noodle. The pork chop was so tasty and the sausage was juicy and full of flavor, reminded me of the night markets in Taiwan. However, the vegetables served were over cooked and sad looking, and the rice was clumpy and mushy. The rice noodle had three large shrimps and overall had a great authentic taste but it was on the colder side. I ordered ahead for pickup and arrived within fifteen minutes of my phoned order. I think they just make a big batch of everything and package it up and when you come and pick up they just give you what you ordered. This can explain the cold noodles. I tried both the savory and sweet soups. Savory one tasted like a pork bone broth with seaweed, ginger and fish balls. The sweet one is like red bean soup with grass jelly, sago, taro and whatever is left over in it. I enjoyed both soups, flavors were very Taiwanese.

The workers there are an older couple, so speed is not their high point. However, they are very polite and understanding. They also make some delicious food that is well worth the wait. The price is cheap too.    I got the crispy chicken cutlet with Taiwanese sausage railroad bento box. The amount of food for that price was insane. Huge chicken cutlets, marinated boiled egg, veggies and the sausage all over white rice. It also came with a soup but I forgot about that and left it in my car for a few days. . .    Bottom line, order ahead, find parking, and enjoy.",Pearl Garden,14508 14th Ave
44386,4,174,Chinese,5,01/26/2023,"Place your order ahead of time!  There is limited staff here so sometimes the order takes a little longer to get BUT it is totally worth the wait. The meals are beautifully prepared and very flavorful with each portion of the dish an expierence in itself, the way home cooked chinese food tastes like. Totally worth it. Been coming back to this place three times since I first tried it earlier this week.",Pearl Garden,14508 14th Ave
44387,5,174,Chinese,5,07/30/2022,Hands down and by far the best Taiwanese bento box. You can’t go wring with either pork or chicken leg over rice in all of Queens. If you don’t trust me or then look at all the other reviews they gave five stars. I this little mom and pop takeout is something special. Been coming here for over 10 years snd still no other is comparable. Each take out Bento comes with a homemade soup of day as well. $11 per bento is a bargain.,Pearl Garden,14508 14th Ave
44388,6,174,Chinese,5,05/26/2022,Their chicken leg and pork chop railroad bento is amazing. They're open on Mondays and Tuesdays but only take over the phone order. Wednesdays through Sundays they have sweet soup along with their regular soup.,Pearl Garden,14508 14th Ave
44389,7,174,Chinese,5,02/25/2023,Food is always fantastic here and their pork chop is cooked to perfection. The restaurant is locally owned by two lovely elderly couple and they put their love and expertise into the food. Would visit here for a full and hearty meal and the price is reasonable too.,Pearl Garden,14508 14th Ave
44390,8,174,Chinese,5,02/25/2023,"The Chicken cutlet  and chicken leg lunch box are definitely good,  you just have to be patient and wait, since it is 2 seniors operating inside.   Price  is similar as Flushing lunch box but you will get a lot more here, only Con is waiting a little bit longer but parking is much easier here.",Pearl Garden,14508 14th Ave
44391,9,174,Chinese,1,05/12/2023,"It's not a place for dining in, just for fetching your order. The inside space is just enough for customers withdrawing what they've ordered previously. A front desk divide the space between customers and the open kitchen. The menu which is already published in some posts here doesn't match reality. Paying with credit card isn't an option, just cash. Decadent and run out",Pearl Garden,14508 14th Ave

44398,17,174,Chinese,5,05/27/2019,"Not your normal Chinese Take out.  You have been warned.  However the food is unbelievable.  It's a Taiwanese restaurant.  It's feels like my grandmother serving me food because a lot of the people here look elderly.    The pork chop is a good combo for $8.  They put stir fried veges, an egg, and jajang over the rice (may not be palatable for some people).  The side soup that's included is also not your typical egg drop soup, hot and sour, or chicken noodle.  Those soups are hardly authentic.  They closely resemble the pitiful Campbell soups.  Today they served jujube infused chicken soup.  Super healthy and hearty.  Every day it's different and it may not be palatable.  I got accustomed to the strange soups coming out of their cauldron and they are truly unique.    They don't accept tips.  I tried but the woman there does not accept.  I'm not sure they deliver but if so I'd tip them pretty well for the care they put into their food.",Pearl Garden,14508 14th Ave
44399,18,174,Chinese,3,10/28/2022,"I have good impressions about the tasty food before. And I came here for over 10 times. However the last time is kind disappointing. I ordered a chicken leg bento box, rice and veggie are very cold and it’s hard to eat, chicken leg is warm to cold, which is not ideal either. Maybe it’s pre-make but they should help to heat it help when somebody ordered. I hope it’s can get better next time.",Pearl Garden,14508 14th Ave
44400,19,174,Chinese,5,05/26/2021,"Best hidden gem in the flushing whitestone area. They may look like a typical chinese takeout place, but what they specialize is actually traditional taiwanese cuisine. Get a stir fried vermicelli with pork chop, or a chicken leg over rice, and you will not be disappointed. All the dishes are sub $10 and they are HUGE servings. Do not miss out on their soups that they serve, it's like what your mom or grandma would cook on a Sunday evening. So satisfying. Go show your support!",Pearl Garden,14508 14th Ave

44405,24,174,Chinese,5,08/29/2022,This is our go-to take-out spot. They have the typical Chinese Take-out menu items but also a Taiwanese specials menu that we always order from. Our usuals are the railroad bentos and noodle with meat sauce. The dishes are consistent and portions are generous. They always give us a home made soup on the side.  :),Pearl Garden,14508 14th Ave
44406,25,174,Chinese,1,08/29/2022,"Ordered a chicken chop bento box, it is covered with a lot of MSG and quite salty. The service is terrible, extremely long wait time even though I have called before. Takes 40+ minutes for me to get my food. This is the second time I’ve been there. I tried the chicken leg bento box last times, it’s pretty good I have to say. But their service is just terrible. They also tend to serve other customer first if they know each other or if they are regular customer. They even gave my order to someone else even they order after me and it happen for both of my visits. The other young lady who works at front desk is nicer. But the boss is terrible.",Pearl Garden,14508 14th Ave

I had called 40mins ago and went to pick up, but I still need to wait to speak with the old lady for my order. They forgot to do my order and she said will give others order to me first. I was not complaining about her, but she said to me  you got to wait in line you know, I will give ur order this time. However, I had saw her to give others order to her old customer/friends. And one time, her friends came in and picked up her order, and then she was asking if any extra meals left over. The owner said no more order left and everyone is waiting, but at the same time, the old lady gave my order to her friend in front of me. The waitress said she(me) is waiting for the meal. The old lady told the waitress no more, she get to wait! It was not the first time, the old lady doing this, so I’m feel very angry but nothing to do with her. She is very old and no extra helper. The waitress is her relatives and only comes in sometimes to help her.",Pearl Garden,14508 14th Ave

44414,36,174,Chinese,4,05/26/2020,Taiwanese home cooking. From the outside it looks a regular American Chinese takeout place but it's not. Favorites are Chicken Leg over rice and Pork Chop over rice. It's a tad sweeter than most other places but still taste good. Beef noodle soup is good but had better tasting soup. Still ok as the beef is very tender. Overall a good place to get a quick Taiwanese good to go,Pearl Garden,14508 14th Ave

44417,39,174,Chinese,5,05/27/2019,"Owner, Taiwanese lady, nice n kind. Beef Brisket rice for $9 is getting not as good as before. We used to get more ""brisket meat"", but due to the cost increase I suppose, and she didn't raise price, those meaty portion has more tendons n etc lately. For me it's cool, I like those also, my wife, who is ABC doesn't like it. She only like pure Chunk of meats. So if you like pure Chunk of meat only, Try their Taiwanese rail benton. But you need to stay very close by, those are deep fried, not good after inside the take out box for over 20 minutes, IMO",Pearl Garden,14508 14th Ave
44418,40,174,Chinese,4,05/26/2022,Their Taiwanese lunch boxes are very good. Zero atmosphere but food is worth it. It is now take out only. But the lunch boxes is still great and worth every penny.,Pearl Garden,14508 14th Ave

They make delicious hearty Taiwanese cuisine like home-made food; I am not Taiwanese but speaking from experience of growing up with Taiwanese friends. The portion is also huge for the price you pay!    It is true that they may not greet you some times (made me feel a little awkward the first time) but didnt take it negatively because I found out that it was because they were simply just busy cooking, not trying to be rude  Hope this review helps!!

44421,44,174,Chinese,4,05/26/2020,My dad’s coworkers rave about this place. We had take out from there one night and it was decent. We were a bit disappointed though. It was a bit salty and lacking in ingredients. It may have been just how they like to make it. It is better than your typical Chinese take out place.,Pearl Garden,14508 14th Ave
44422,45,174,Chinese,5,05/26/2020,"Don’t be fooled by the exterior, the food here is good! I’m a fan of their pork chop over rice and chicken leg. My wife loves the fried fish filet.  Portions are good, price is amazing when considering taste and amount.  Also comes with a sweet or salty soup when ordering their over rice specials. I always go sweet, which ranges from red bean with tapioca, boba to other versions.    This is definitely my go to spot. Can’t beat a fish filet or chicken over rice plus a sweet soup dessert for $8.",Pearl Garden,14508 14th Ave

44425,48,174,Chinese,1,05/26/2021,I ordered pork chop over rice and chicken leg over rice. Both were very dry and not appetizing at all. Both proteins looked like last night leftovers reheated in a microwave. This is unacceptable. Very difficult to recommend this to anyone after this bad experience.,Pearl Garden,14508 14th Ave
44426,49,174,Chinese,4,05/26/2020,"Really tasty, inexpensive and large portions.  Only small downside is very little English spoken here. Their chicken and rice is really tasty, their jajang noodles really hits the spot.  Cannot go wrong here.",Pearl Garden,14508 14th Ave

It looks like a typical Chinese takeout restaurant from the outside but be sure to park and step inside! I was excited with just one look at the menu. Two sides of the menu had all Taiwanese dishes to choose from. We ordered stir fried Taiwanese noodle and the proportion was so generous and loaded with lots of vegetables and shrimp. The Chicken railroad bento box was delicious and the pork chop railroad bento was well flavored and juicy as well. In my opinion, best deal in the Flushing area at $8 per dish!

I don't like that the complimentary crunchy, oily appetizer with duck sauce dips are already laid out on every table ahead of time but they likely do it to be efficient.    Hot tea was served quickly and complimentary.    Beef satay was tender with 5 small skewers with a peanut based sauce. It was good. The peanut saice was not as peanutty however, not good nor bad, but just different.    Salmon w/ scallions was breaded. I wasn't expecting the breading, but it was good. Underneath the breading was real salmon that was cooked to the correct temp. Portion was adequate to good.    Service was quick but felt a bit militaristic.    Overall value (especially if you come and order through their lunch specials 12-3 Monday-Saturday) and experience was good and would come again to try their other dishes.",Meemah,9 Lincoln Hwy
50682,1,213,Chinese,5,11/27/2022,There is not a better restaurant as far as taste this place is really amazing. Just do yourself a favor eat in dine in before ordering take out. The hot food and the taste off the wok will make you smile,Meemah,9 Lincoln Hwy

50684,3,213,Chinese,1,12/27/2022,"Officially, the food has changed ! I loved this place for so many years and it is just not the same . They don’t use true wontons in their soup , they instead use very mushy steamed pork dumplings off their menu . Also the Generals Chicken has no sauce in it and hard vegetables barely cooked . Fried rice had a strong amonia smell . The sweet and sour chicken was now very basic and it isn’t offered in pint size , only dinner size for $16.00 ? Really ?... If you eat in the place they are under-staffed with young kid waitresses who have no clue how to wait on customers . Tables were left with food on them while guests were standing waiting . Also , really , you can’t deliver food yet ? Don’t you make enough money after all these years to hire a delivery person and also update the place inside , it looks like 1980s ? Though they were the best at one time I have come to realize , it’s time to search for a better place now ! The prices have gotten higher but the quality of the food preparation and services have truly declined .",Meemah,9 Lincoln Hwy
50685,4,213,Chinese,5,04/26/2023,"Quite a small establishment for a restaurant. We decided to pickup dinner here on the way home from the Convention Center. Food was pretty good. This was also reflected by how busy it was for takeout. Not completely authentic Chinese food, although it had some good choices to make up for it. Although quite a distance from us I'd go back again if in the nabe. One caveat - a touch pricey.",Meemah,9 Lincoln Hwy
50686,5,213,Chinese,4,04/26/2023,"Meemah offers a mix of Chinese and Malaysian food.

I highly recommend their stuff. Portions are huge, taste is phenomenal and authentic, prices are fair. Their signature dishes are the Pork Chop over Rice, Chicken Leg over Rice, and Fish Fillet over Rice.    I do have several complaints. If Mandarin is not part of your dialect, you may struggle a bit ordering over the phone. And be mindful when ordering around lunch time, as they have a pretty large crowd of regulars that order around the same time and you WILL be waiting for a while.    Highly recommended. Worth the wait and money.",Pearl Garden,14508 14th Ave

The food came quickly and was awesome. The wonton soup was not way too salty, as it is in some Chinese places. We had some chicken in a ginger sauce and chicken and scallops on a sizzling platter. You could taste how fresh it all was. We ate way too much and we'll be going back soon",Meemah,9 Lincoln Hwy

The pork dumplings were nasty.  The watered down sauce  tasted better and that is not saying much.  The Moo Shu pork was inedible I mean absolutely disgusting.

50718,38,213,Chinese,1,05/27/2017,"I work at the hospital nearby and my department orders food from there. Yesterday was the worst experience ever. The older Asian lady was extremely rude over the phone, yelling at us saying that we weren't telling her the numbers of the food items.. Now, if you look at the menu, there are Chinese symbols next to the items, not numbers. So she continued to get flustered and scream at my coworker who was placing the order and ended up hanging up on my coworker.  So we finally go pick up the food. I ordered steamed chicken and zucchini .. All I received was vegetables, no meat. I called her back to let her know that I had asked for chicken and she started screaming at me saying ""YOU DID NOT ORDER THAT!!!! IF YOU ORDERED THAT I WOULD HAVE CHARGED YOU 13$ not $10!!!! YOU NO ORDER IT WITH CHICKEN. I ASK THE GIRL IF SHE WANT A NUMBER 2 AND SHE SAY YES"". I said no ma'am she did not order just vegetables , I was right there when she told you, chicken was written on the paper she was reading from.  She continued to scream at me and told me that if I wanted chicken I had to go there and order  chicken and pay for it.. I was tired of being screamed out so I just hung up the phone.  Then my other coworker was looking for her meal, and it was not there. So we're not sure if she charged us for it or not because the receipt just has the amount on it, not what was ordered.  So overall, we got screamed at for no reason, was missing a meal and received a wrong meal.  Surely, we will never go back there. Never have I ever been treated so poorly by restaurant management. You just lost a big order meemahs, hope you're happy.  Our department will never order from you again.",Meemah,9 Lincoln Hwy

The tipping has been grabbed by the cashier lady running to the table as soon as we tip and getting ready to leave. Looks like they never bother to give that tip to the waiter who served us but the cashier will put it in the register.  Next day, we did  not tip because we knew that the management would not allow the waiter to take it -Surprisingly this old Asian lady ran after us to the parking lot and demanded tip with rude tone.",Meemah,9 Lincoln Hwy

50725,45,213,Chinese,4,05/27/2018,"Meemah is a long New York Times praise recipient for their quality kitchen. Thru the years, the restaurant offered Maleasian Chinese cousine in the Edison area, lead by the iron hand of former owner Kathy, who recently retired. This BYO place is located in a small free-parking strip mall and can boast no great ambiance or service but the certainty of a decent lunch or dinner at reasonable prices. Their menu offers mostly Chinese dishes that are better than others in the  area. For old customers, the recent change of administraton brought fears of deminished quality that proved unfounded when the smart choice of making no changes by the new owners, was evident.

Each time I tried them they showed a flare of doing things just a little different, that something extra that set them apart.  The food is always fresh and tasty. They have unique menu items like ""mayonnaise chicken"" and others that are really worth trying. Friendly and helpful describes them well.  This has without a doubt become my go to place for satisfying my hunger.  They have their version of ""Buffalo wings"" I prefer these to both the ""Dominos"" and the ""Cluck-u"" outlet right next door. As a matter of fact, I walk past both to get them from #1!    It's been about 2 years since I posted this review. I must add that there have been many orders placed in the last few years.  I still go here for ""buffalo wings"" and know that my hunger will always be satisfied with a tasty meal.",No. 1 Restaurant,1748 E 2nd St
52254,23,221,Chinese,2,05/26/2020,This place should is very disappointing if I can be quite honest. It is situated in a very good location near downtown Scotch Plains. Parking in never an issue here (free parking) and they are open during convenient times. Unfortunately I CAN NOT recommend this place to anyone.    The food I received was not fresh and it had a bad odor overall. What did I order ? General Chicken and a separate order of Beef Broccoli in sauce.  The only reason this locale is not receiving my dreaded 1 star kiss of death is because I didn't get sick from eating the little bit that I did consume and staff was generally pleasant. The leftover food I had to throw it to the pigeons.     My Conclusion: save yourself the bad food and head on over to: Hung Shanghai Restaurant nearby (about 2-3 min. via car) is much much better and worth going to instead !  #justsaying #yourwelcome,No. 1 Restaurant,1748 E 2nd St
52255,24,221,Chinese,5,05/27/2019,My absolute favorite Chinese food store! Food is always fresh and flavorful and they are willing to make changes based on dietary needs.

52262,31,221,Chinese,1,05/26/2020,Nothing about this place is good. When you order fried rice for extra charge to your dinner and upon opening it’s just greasy yellow rice that’s a warning sign. My dish and my wife’s dish was dry as a Sahara desert with bland flavors and a stale taste to it. There are times in life when you wish you can take things back and unfortunately we are unable too.

52270,39,221,Chinese,5,05/27/2019,"Well as somebody who has been going here for 20 years I say..... there’s a reason I have been going here for 20 years. This restaurant has been the best in terms of service, hospitality and is a quite an example to follow for over general service and vibe.    Sue, the women behind the counter is a prime example of a restaurant owner who cares about her customers not just from the intention of preparing every meal with top quality and love but she asks about how people have been, what goes on in their lives, and other things. This is a genuine indication of a town friendly and community vibe and spirit that helps keep Scotch Plains, a town heavily prevalent with small businesses a vibrant caring and welcoming community. This to me is a key example of service on the 3 dimensional level rather than the whole  I’m just selling them food mentality. Me my mother and my brother always come here and have been proud to come here for pretty much what is my whole life.    Favorite dishes include:    Boneless Spare Ribs (both lunch and dinner combinations)    Kung Pao Chicken (both lunch and dinner combination)    Shrimp Egg Foo Young with gravy.    The wings too..... can’t  forget those.    Crab Rangoon off the appetizers section.    The Dragon and Phoenix...... ( this is a top choice)    *** recently I have developed a hot and sour soup addiction....

57344,9,252,Chinese,1,05/26/2022,"I live near the place so it’s convenient and since it’s busy it seems like people prefer it. I buy from here because I see their food is probably moving so they probably don’t sell old food stacked up that no one is ordering (not a fact just my opinion, I may be wrong).    I should have wrote a review years ago. This place is a rip off. I’ve asked them for extra vegetables, they charge $2 and today they added 2 cut skinny tall thin broccoli. Usually they don’t add ANY VEGETABLES AT ALL!?!?!    I paid $2 extra for what?!??? I’ve told them extra hot AND spicy and they literally ignored this. Some old Chinese man that works there talks as if he’s doing me a favor by allowing me to order. I asked for fortune cookies and the old man said yes I put them in and there was NOTHING.    I have done delivery and pickup and both are trash. They don’t put in proper stuff, there’s always something missing. I pay money and money doesn’t grow on trees. Why would they charge for service they don’t provide. With the way they are ripping people off they are bound to go out of business soon because dishonesty doesn’t provide success. SHAME ON YOU!!!!",China Town Restaurant,763 St Georges Ave

With that said:    Main Moon has the best Chinese food in the area by far. I've tried almost every other place in Linden, but nothing comes even close to these guys.    Every single order I've gotten from them has been perfect and absolutely delicious. Every new order I make exceeds my expectations.    I am VERY grateful to have a place like them nearby. I'm serious - their food is wonderful.    -Erik with the General Tso's Chicken with white meat (not spicy). :)",Main Moon Chinese Restaurant,427 N Wood Ave
