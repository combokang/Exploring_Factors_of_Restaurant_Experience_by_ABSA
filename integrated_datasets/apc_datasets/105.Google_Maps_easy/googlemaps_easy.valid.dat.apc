" I used to go to this place for years when I worked over in Iselin . What happened to Meemah ? The place has changed since they got new ownership . They are not friendly . The greeter was unwelcoming to me and 1st time guests . The waiter was rude and snatched the menu from my hand and more over they over peppered my food because the $T$ was too spicy to eat . And the quality of the chicken was spongy . I would never go there again . If I could give them Zero stars I would . So sad , it used to be nice . "

Great $T$ and staff ! Made it in time for the lunch special and it was great . The smaller sizes were perfect and it ' s a shame it ' s not available on the regular menu for those with weight management concerns . Great waitress and hostess - we tried a new wine ( remember to ask for your wine sample ) and ended up buying the bottle . It was cheaper for the 3 of us . Well definitely be back !

" Reasonably priced Thai food . They have a good variety of items and do the classics very well . It ' s americanized Thai , so expect dishes to be more sweet , less spicy . Portions are super generous and prices are fair . $T$ is friendly and the ambiance is festive . "

" Diner looking place , the only thing that gives you an impression of Thailand is the random table in the middle of the restaurant where $T$ keep plates and utensils . After coming back from Thailand nothing in NJ comes close to the authentic Thai food . Pad Thai here which is marked " " best seller in NJ " " was sub par compare to Pho Thai - Lao Kitchen in Maywood , NJ ( still the best pad thai for my taste buds ) . "

" Our $T$ was not attentive at all . We had a party of 10 , no extra napkins , only the ones the utensils are wrapped in . Never came back to ask if we wanted extra bread , soup or salad nor to refill our drinks . When one one person in our group asked for another soup it took forever to bring , to the point we all finished our dinner and the soup had not arrived . Never got the chocolates you normally get with your bill , which is no big deal , but the kids look forward to those . "

They aren ’ t open 24 / 7 like their $T$ says ! It ’ s a scam and they are only open 12 - 6 . So be prepared to be disappointed .
