Our family went to try this restaurant on a late Sunday afternoon on a relatively nice day . I called beforehand to ensure they had outdoor seating available on that day and time . We had been looking forward to trying the restaurant as they have advertised about their outdoor tent area . When we arrived the $T$ said he wouldn ' t seat us outside because they did not want to go in and out to serve people . What ! ! ! ? ! ? ? ? ? ? ! We drove over 30 minutes to get there and had to turn around and head home .

The $T$ was horrible . Took us an hour to get seated and an additional 20 mins to get served drinks not food . I had my 2 toddlers with me but luckily as a mom i had snacks and drinks for them while we waited and ended up taking their meal home . Smh never again ! I would have appreciated it if they were honest n told us the appropriate waiting time than continually saying 10 minutes more .

Horrible customer $T$ an employee by the name of Kevin ( if that ’ s even his real name ) was rude and dismissive over the phone when I called to ask about happy hour .

I ’ ve never been to this restaurant and I always wanted to try it out but I ’ m definitely not going at all . Also when I asked to speak with the manager he says in regards to ? Questioning me as if he owns the place . I work as a restaurant manager myself and your employees make or break your business ! ! Don ’ t have people running your establishment that don ’ t want to do their job ! ! ! ! ! ! I ’ m very upset with the service I received and I will be writing a review on yelp as well .

The place does not have a good $T$ . They hired a bunch of kids that don ' t even know how to wait on tables . We sat there for over 15 minutes waiting to be asked if we wanted something to drink . Then at no time did they even return back toask us if we needed anything else . They did the same thing to the table right next to us . We had to ask someone to come by just to get water refills ! Ridiculous ! ! !

" I ' m a big fan of olive garden and Italian kitchen overall . This used to be a good olive garden location but not anymore . The $T$ were not friendly at all , the place smelled bad , the food was not good . What mostly bothered me is that servers were not wearing anything to cover their hair while carrying food . There were literally girls carrying a tray of food and their hair was falling inside the tray ! That was disgusting . Thankfully our food was brought by someone else . Overall not a good experience .

" This place  is busy and also on Eater ’ s list as one of the top places to go to in Chinatown . After the food tonight , I won ’ t be going back . We had the eggplant , stewed pork , soup dumplings , and whole fish with pine nuts . The soup dumplings have a thick skin and burst easily when picked up . It doesn ’ t have the bounciness you want . The ones with crab were also lacking in the fresh sweetness that crab meat usually brings to the soup dumplings . The eggplant tasted inauthentic and overtly sweet and minimal minced meat . No real highlight dish for us . Definitely more tailored towards an Americanized Chinese palate than authentic Shanghai tastes .    The $T$ was pretty quick and efficient . There are better Shanghainese options . "

The $T$ is good . Price is too high . The tip should be at the discretion of the customer not their decision . There shouldn ' t be an extra 10 % charge for paying with a credit card . The drinks are great but not worth paying extra money just to go have it .

$T$ is OK . I was thrilled to learn it was vegetarian / vegan . Drove 30 minutes to try this place . Person in the front was nice and polite . Food was a bit spicy despite me choosing not spicy . The biggest disappointment was the sticky rice . I just got a small glob for $ 3 . 50 . Maybe the presentation threw me off but i didn ’ t expect it to be a literal small scoop of rice  . Overall we would definitely go back and next time we will dine in and see how that experience is .

" Wow , I was amazed ! This is a definite 4 . 5 to me . All I care about is food quality and this is one of the only times I have liked chicken tikka . The balance of spice , heat , and flavor was right on point . The naan was soft hot and pillowy . Finally , the $T$ was great - - I have more than enough for two meals at $ 13 for lunch . Just make sure to ask for something made today . Cheers ! "

" Looks are deceiving . $T$ looks decent but the food looks like you can make it at home in a microwave . Horrible service . Almost killed my friend with an onion allergy he asked multiple times if there were onions . They said there were no onions in anything he ordered , everything he ordered came with onions . "

" $T$ was pretty good . The Morel burger was a little overdone ; I asked for medium and it was closer to well done . Cheese topping on burger wasn ' t melted but it was a tasty burger , nevertheless . Fries were good too . Had the crab cake as an appetizer and it was delicious . My wife had the vegetarian Cajun dish and said it was good too . A little on the pricey side , but presentation and quality were good , so worth the visit . "

" Probably not the best spot for Tibetan $T$ . Momo ' s were spread out on plate , I don ' t know if it ' s for presentation or if it ' s to make it look more . It didn ' t worked for either purpose . We went for some warm Tibetan food on cold rainy evening but didn ' t really helped .

" I was expecting more . The design is amazing , the $T$ was ok . The food was standard for these kinds of places nothing exciting , the ceviche over dressed , not subtle at all . The sushi and scallops were very good . But most of all the service was just odd - drinks took forever and a lot of staff had a " " not my job " " response for requests or questions . I ' ll give them another try in a few months when they ' ve settled in . For now , it feels like there ' s room for improvement . "

" We enjoyed the $T$ and the service . Just one thing marred our visit . I called the restaurant before leaving the house to ask if it was a BYOB and was told , yes , you can bring your own bottle . So we were unpleasantly surprised to find a corkage fee of $ 10 . 00 on our bill . When I questioned the waitress , she responded that they always charge this fee . When I told her about my call to the restaurant , she lowered it to $ 5 . 00 ; still left a bad taste . "

Wonderful place with excellent $T$ ! The vibe in here is relaxing with great staff . We decided to sit at the bar and we are glad we did because the bartender there was excellent . Drinks were on point and the food was even better . My wife had the penne and I had the gnocchi . Price was fair for 2 people . Will definitely be coming back here again . Well run establishment .

" Vegetarian restaurant . Nice interior and ambiance .    Flavorful food , however they ' re a bit on the greasy side . The fried rice was greasy even when asked to go light on the oil . $T$ was a little too wet to my liking but there was flavor . The same goes for the roti .    If you don ' t mind the grease and glistening rice , the food is fine . "

" $T$ was not bad . Could have provided larger portions all around considering the prices . Now for the reason to not go : SERVICE - Trying to ask a question , no one to be found , yet there were 10 or more waiters . Trying to get a drink , takes one drink order , there were 4 of us and the other 3 had to wait until the waiter returned . Placing an appetizer order and placing a dinner order , forgettaboutit ! ! You are waiting ! ! Did I say there were 10 plus waiters in the restaurant . Try asking a question , exactly , try asking a question . Oh , I forgot , ONE bartender ( it was a Friday night ) , very nice young lady , but there is no way you should have one bartender behind the bar handling table and bar orders on a Friday night . BTW Manager made pretend he cared when these issues we brought to his attention . My recommendation : Skip this place . The star above is because I could rate it - 5 ! ! "

" $T$ was excellent , but the maintenance is terrible . As soon as I stepped in the whole place had a weird smell . The floor was dirty so as the table . We had to move to another table by ourselves as there was no staff to assist . Bathroom floor was wet and tissues all over the floor . I guess Olive Garden doesn ' t even care much to this location . If this continues to go on then sorry olive garden . "

" I have stopped going to olive garden long back . I was forced to go this time to use my gift card and boy it did disappoint as expected . Filthy place as shown . $T$ was below average . I just couldn ' t eat it . Wasted 80 % of it and never bothered packing as I know I won ' t like it . The only good part was the desert . Other than that it was a dud . This is my last visit to olive garden . If I get a olive garden gift card next time , I will donate it away . "

" $T$ ! ! ! It came crawling onto my son ’ s spoon as we were eating . And usually if you see tiny cockroaches , then you may have an infestation . So we stopped eating immediately and left . We almost didn ’ t pay bc they made us wait 30 - 40mins to pay ! Moving on the food : egg rolls were old and juicy , pad Thai was mediocre , rice dish was okay , but the basil dish wasn ’ t all that bad . Service was okay but not the greatest , especially for us being the only ones dinning in . Napkins were so old they were stiff , and silverware were super dirty so we asked for chopsticks . I ’ m sure these a great people but may be in an old place or need more staff . A lot of potential . Would not recommend only bc of the small cockroach I had to kill mid dining . "

The restaurant is much worse than it used to be . The owner and chef have changed . The $T$ have gone up and the portions have gotten ridiculously smaller . It looks like it ' s designed for a 3 year old . Yesterday we made an order and at home we saw that only 4 small pieces of shish kebab were included in the portion . All . !

I don ’ t frequent Olive Garden . This is only my second time going to one aside from the one in Garden city . The $T$ wasn ’ t bad . Except we had to change our table . There were several micro ants on my side of the table . I almost didn ’ t notice . That why I gave it a 3 . We got an apology which is great from the waiter but tbh the Mgr should have offered their apologies . I still felt a bit uncomfortable but I wasn ’ t dining alone . Overall it was ok . The prices are decent and the lunch menu is good .

" This place is a hidden gem - if you ' re in the mood for a cheap , Korean meal ( particularly great for lunch cause it ' s very much grab and go ) this is the place to be . Pictured below is the kimchi fried rice and bulgogi $T$ . It ' s also 5 % off your bill if you pay in cash and a $ 15 credit card minimum . "

The restaurant itself has a nice aesthetic and the $T$ is very well presented but definitely doesn ' t live up to expectations flavor / price wise . The lobster is fried in the shell so the coating ends up staying there and the waffles didn ' t have anything going for them without the ( very good ) caramel or syrup . Worth a revisit for the dinner menu since we did go too early for some of the other options .

It ' s a family business , they ' re incredibly friendly , the menu is huge ( and includes lots of Mexican specialties ) , the food is great , the portions are massive , and the $T$ is really nice ( including their outdoor seating ) . This is the kind of homey , cozy restaurant that seems to be disappearing from the city ( RIP Teresa ' s in BK Heights ) , so I ' m so happy to see it in the Slope . Please support this great business ! "

" We were waiting table for 40 $T$ , it ’ s not a big deal . BUT we waiting a waitress to take an order for another 25 and she took an order only because we asked a busboy to get the waitress , she forgot to add sushi to the order and we got our drinks when we finished the food . It was one of my favorite places of Asian food . First time ever , I so disappointed . "

While I understand that during dinner rush $T$ can get overwhelmed and be slightly less attentive than they would be during other hours it was hard to barely have any service at all . Our table was never cleared so when our main course arrived I had to pick up and move our plates around and then take the plates from the runner and place them where they needed to go . Either more staff or better management is required .

I went to Mariachi 2 years ago with my dad and I loved the $T$ and the ambiance . But today we ordered their food again and my chicken tacos were so underwhelming . They came with super tiny corn tortillas and the chicken fell out . The chicken was really bland and dry . The rice and beans looked good but when I tasted them I didn ' t like them either ; everything was so bland . I was so disappointed by this meal . The only thing that tasted good was the guacamole .
