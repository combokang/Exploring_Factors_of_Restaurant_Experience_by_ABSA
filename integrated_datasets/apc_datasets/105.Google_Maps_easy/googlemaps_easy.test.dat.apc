" The $T$ has gone down the hill . 10 + years ago when the original founders the food was fantastic , I was a regular twice a week for the deviled fish and Kothu . As owners changed , the food is a disaster . Unfortunately , it ' s the only Sri Lankan restaurant in NJ now . I wish they bring the authenticity of the Sri Lankan food back . Please improve your food . The service is okay . It would be nice if they can keep the place a little cleaner . "

" They were missing a couple of main ticket items we came here for ( " " ran out " " ) . $T$ was good and cheap but portions were very skimpy . Would rather pay more and receive more instead of having to order double .    Keep in mind that they auto charge gratuity for anything over 4 people . 22 % gratuity is a bit outrageous considering we barely saw the waiters . Overall ok , but not what you see on instagram . "

" The $T$ was very bland .  The stuffed artichoke was so bland the breading on top was to mushy no flavor at all missing salt .    The lasagna seemed good until I bit it and it was cold . The sauce on top was hot which means the lasagna was made separately from the sauce weird .    Very bland food . Bread in the beginning was good . Service was good but definitely not the best Italian food .    I read the reviews after I ordered and realized some people have also complained about cold and bland food . "

sushi
Positive
" Food is very good . Drinks too . Best to order the value special . Sushi chef is KING ! Who would have thought that a " " grill " " restaurant would have the best sushi I ' ve had for months ! 4 stars due to $T$ . New wait staff is clumsy , inexperienced , and confused . The guys need more training . The hostess isn ' t customer focused , even in a lull . New patio is lovely , although fire element wasn ' t working . Will return for the sushi . "
